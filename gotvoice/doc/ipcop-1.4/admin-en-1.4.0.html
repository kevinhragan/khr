On behalf of our Project Leader, Jack Beglinger, the Documentation staff would
                   like to welcome you to the IPCop Users Administration Document.  We would like to take this
                   opportunity to thank you for trying our firewall and we hope that it will serve your needs. The
                   team would also like to thank the IPCop Linux Community for its continuing presence and the
                   outstanding job it does helping new and experienced users alike.  We would also like to thank
                   the team at SmoothWall for bringing the IPCop Linux Community together.</p><p>Whether you are an existing user moving up the version chain or a new user getting
                   ready for your first install, we hope you will find all you need to get up and running in this manual.
                   If, for some reason, something is not covered here and you feel it should be, then by all means
                   contact us and let us know. We always like to hear from our user base (actually some of us are
                   just kinda lonely sitting on the computer all day and a little note is nice every once in a while)
                   and hope to be able to accommodate their needs as much as possible. Now you can relax
                   and enjoy the Internet without having to worry.</p><p>So, here is a bit of information for those of you that have the time to read this and are
                   waiting for your IPCop Linux box to install.  The initial release of IPCop was an interim release
                   to assist us in finding problems in the IPCop Linux Distribution. We are now on our third full
                   release.  If you do happen to find problems, please check the IPCop FAQ first as we attempt
                   to update the FAQ as soon as we find a problem and can provide solid information on either
                   a work around or a direct fix.</p><p>If your problem is not referenced in the FAQ then you can either join us on IRC
                   (server: irc.openprojects.net channel: #ipcop), contact the IPCop mailing list or send the
                   IPCop Linux Group an email for direct support. Please be advised that you will more than
                   likely receive a faster response and solution by using the first 3 methods listed above. Contacting
                   the IPCop Linux Group directly could have a large delay, depending upon our development
                   schedule.</p><p>You may find further information as well as the newest FAQ, mailing list information

        Now, what is IPCop?
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
                IPCop is a firewall; first, last and always.
            </p></li><li><p>
                IPCop is a specialized Linux Distribution; complete, configured, and ready to
                protect your network.
                Further, it is distributed under the
                <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_top">
                    GNU General Public License</a>,
                complete source ready to be downloaded, reviewed, or even be modified
                and/or recompiled by yourself for your personal needs or security reasons.
            </p></li><li><p>
                IPCop is a community; where members help each other, all sharing to improve
                the project and each other.
                This help goes from simple &#8220;<span class="quote">Networking 101</span>&#8221;type of instruction
                and direction, to helping members customize their IPCop to meet a specialized
                needs such as Net-Phones (VoIP) and multiple office integration.
            </p></li></ol></div><p>
        This was a trick question.
        The correct answer is: All of the above.
    </p><p>
        Background:
    </p><p>
        IPCop grew out of many needs.
        The first of those needs was a need for secure protection of our personal and commercial
        networks.
        When IPCop started October 2001, there were other firewalls available.
        However, the team that started IPCop felt that the other two needs that IPCop fills were not
        addressed; GPL and a sense of community.
    </p><p>
        The IPCop founding group decided to do things differently and forked the base GPL
        code of an existing firewall and started out anew, looking to keep user community needs in
        the forefront.
        Among those needs is the need of the user to make IPCop their own, to install
        improvements, to just learn by seeing what others have done.
        Through these needs is where development gets some of improvements to IPCop,
        directly listening and seeing what has been done and why.
        This community makes IPCop grow and IPCop helps them grow.
    </p><p>
        Now, after almost two and a half years, the first major overhaul of IPCop has been released.
        With it, a lot of cool things have been added; quad network support, intrusion detection on
        all networks and a slick new interface, to name a few.
    </p><p>
        And so again, Welcome to IPCop!

            IPCop software is both a collaborative project and built upon great prior
            works.
            These acknowledgements will cover many to help both directly and
            indirectly, but will never the less miss untold many who toiled to help
            develop this project but I failed to get them noted here.
            To those, I say many thanks and sorry for missing your name.
        </p><p>
            For the rest, thank you&#8230;

        To access the IPCop GUI is as simple as starting your browser and entering the IP address
        (of the green IPCop interface) or hostname of your IPCop server along with a port director of
        either 445 (https/secure) or 81(redirected to 445):
        <a href="https://ipcop:445" target="_top">https://ipcop:445</a> or
        <a href="https://192.168.10.1:445" target="_top">https://192.168.10.1:445</a> or
        <a href="http://ipcop:81" target="_top">http://ipcop:81</a> or
        <a href="http://192.168.10.1:81" target="_top">http://192.168.10.1:81</a>.
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note:  Deprecation of HTTP Port 81 Connections</h3><p>
            As of IPCop Release 1.4.0, http connections to port 81 will be redirected to https on port 445.
            Several years ago, when IPCop was originally designed, a small fraction of browsers could
            not handle the https protocol, so http on port 81 was made available.
            Most of these browsers have fallen out of use and sending IPCop passwords in the clear,
            over http is inherently dangerous, so http connections have been deprecated.
            For those in the habit of using port 81, the connection will be automatically redirected to
            https.
            If you are still using a browser that can not handle https, please download one of the many
            browsers that can and use it.
        </p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Changing the HTTPS Port</h3><p>
            Some Users need to change the port used for secure connections to avoid a clash
            with port 445, which recent versions of Windows use for Directory Services 
            (SMB over TCP/IP). Some ISPs routinely block port 445 as a security measure,
            to prevent the spread of viruses.
        </p><p>
            A commandline utility <span><b class="command">setreservedports</b></span> was introduced in 
            version 1.4.8 to allow Users to change the secure port.
        </p><p>
            </p><pre class="screen"><tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>/usr/local/bin/setreservedports 5445</tt></b>
            </pre><p>
        </p><p>
            Although 5445 is suggested here as the alternative port, any port number between 
            445 and 65535 is allowed. If you forget which port you changed https to, use 
            http and port 81 to be automatically redirected.
         </p></div><p>You should now be looking at the Home Page of your IPCop server's Administration
    GUI. You can immediately start exploring the different options and the information available
    to you through this interface. Below, we have listed the Main Configuration/Administration
    Options available through the GUI. When you have acquainted yourself sufficiently with the
    system, please continue with the next section.</p><p>

        The Home web page is one of several web pages that will look differently
        depending on the way IPCop is configured.
        If your Internet connection is via an Ethernet RED interface the Home web
        page will only not show the current connection name, etc.
    </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/home.png" align="middle" alt="Home Page, Ethernet Connection"></div></div><p>If all went well during the configuration of your PPP connection and PPP is the

         This line is basically the output of the Linux <span><b class="command">uptime</b></span> command and
         displays the current time, the days/hours/minutes that IPCop has been running
         without a reboot, number of users logged in to the IPCop server, and the load

         that you have not yet installed, you will be informed via this page.
     </p><p>
         IPCop has two web users, in addition to the root login user. The
         first is called &#8220;<span class="quote">admin</span>&#8221;. Authenticating as this user gives access
         to all Administrative Webpages. The other user, called &#8220;<span class="quote">dial</span>&#8221;, 
         is able only to use the
         <span class="guibutton">Connect</span> or <span class="guibutton">Disconnect</span> buttons.
         By default, the &#8220;<span class="quote">dial</span>&#8221; user is disabled; to enable it you must set
         a password for that user. No password is required to view the Home or Credits
         webpages. All others require the &#8220;<span class="quote">admin</span>&#8221; password.

            Every time you connect to the Internet IPCop will check for
            any new Updates that may be available.
            You may also manually check for updates by clicking the
            <span class="guibutton">Refresh update list</span>.
            When a new patch is available you will see the information on
            screen with the short description and a link for more
            information.
            Follow the &#8220;<span class="quote">Info</span>&#8221; link.
            When you have followed the link you will see a
            page with all relevant information about the patch including
            a download link.
        </p><p>
            Downloading the patch will place it on the machine you are
            running your web browser on, not the IPCop machine.
            Once you have downloaded the patch simply use the Update page to
            <span class="guibutton">Browse</span>
            to where you saved it and then

            Similar to the HTTP and HTTPS ports for the IPCop machine being
            switched to ports 81 and 445, the SSH port on the IPCop machine
            is switched to 222.
            If you are using a GUI based application to access your IPCop machine,
            remember to specify port 222.
            If you are using the ssh, scp or sftp commands, the syntax for specifying
            non-standard ports is different for each command, even though they
            are related.
            Assuming your IPCop machine is at IP address 192.168.254.1, the

                            You are on the road and something goes wrong with one of your servers.
                            You haven't set up a road warrior VPN connection.
                            If you know your IPCop root password you can use SSH port forwarding to
                            get through your firewall and get access to a server on one of your protected
                            networks.
                            These next few paragraphs will discuss how to do this, assuming you have
                            a Telnet server running on an internal computer at 10.0.0.20.
                            It also assumes your remote machine is a Linux machine.
                            The putty SSH command on Windows has the same capabilities, but they
                            are accessed via dialog boxes.
                            You may already have done one or more of the first two steps.

                        installation.
                        The IPCop translation group is planning on making more
                        languages available as volunteers aid the translation effort.
                        When new languages become available, these are added via the
                        regular system updates.
                    </p><p>
                        Of course, you may wish to translate IPCop to another
                        language yourself.
                        If you do, we urge you to contact the IPCop Translation
                        Coordinator, Eric Oberlander, <tt class="email">&lt;<a href="mailto:eoberlander@users.sourceforge.net">eoberlander@users.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;</tt>,
                        first.
                        He may be aware of on-going translation projects for your
                        language.
                        Please check the

            Backup Web Page
        </h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            There are two ways to back up IPCop and three ways to restore it.
            One backup creates disk files and one puts its output on a floppy.
        </p><p>
            Creating a backup floppy limits the amount of data saved, since the result
            must fit onto a 1.44 MB floppy.
            It is, however, the backup used when restoring IPCop from scratch.
            During IPCop installation, you will be prompted for a floppy disk to restore.
            All settings saved on the floppy will be restored, and installation will complete.
        </p><p>
            When first creating backup files IPCop creates two files, a tar.gz file and a .dat file.
            It also creates a unique backup key that will be used to encrypt all the
            tar.gz files.
            The <span class="guilabel">Encrypted</span> and <span class="guilabel">Unencrypted</span>
            descriptions of the files are misnomers.
            While the .dat file is encrypted, the encryption is used to &#8220;<span class="quote">sign</span>&#8221;
            the .dat file, so it can't be accidentally restored on a different IPCop machine.
            Once a key has been created, only .dat files can be used for a restore.
        </p><p>
            For full backup/restore protection
            <span class="strong">all</span>
            methods and files should be used for backups, as explained in the following
            scenarios.

                        Then import the .tar.gz file to the new IPCop machine and restore all
                        settings and logs.

                This panel of the Backup web page manages the creation, export, import and restore of
                IPCop file backups.
                By clicking on the
                <span class="guibutton">create</span> button, IPCop will create a backup key, if one has not
                been created previously, and create the two backup files.
                If this is the first time you've created backup files, the text in the
                <span class="guibutton">Import .tar.gz</span> button will change to
                <span class="guibutton">Import .dat</span>.
                This indicates that in the future only .dat files may be imported.
                Next, export both files to the computer you are running your web browser on
                by clicking on their <span class="guilabel">Export</span> links.
            </p><p>

                Or import a saved .dat file from another machine.

                This panel of the Backup Web Page will let you back up your IPCop configuration
                to a floppy disk.
                The easiest way to restore your configuration is to reinstall
                IPCop from CD-ROM or HTTP/FTP.
                Early in the installation process, you will be asked if you
                have a floppy with an IPCop system configuration on it.
                If you wish to restore your configuration from a backup floppy,
                place the floppy disk in the floppy drive and select the
                <span class="guibutton">Restore</span> button.
                Your configuration will be restored and installation will
                terminate.
            </p><p>
                After installation completes, you can use the Backup Web page
                to import an unsigned .tar.gz file and restore from it, regaining
                missing logs, etc.
            </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
                    At this time, IPCop will not overwrite DOS formatted
                    floppy disks.
                    To format a floppy disk for IPCop, you will need to
                    format it for Linux.
                    The command to do this is:
                </p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">#</tt> <b class="userinput"><tt>fdformat /dev/fd0</tt></b>
</pre><p>
                    If you have another Linux machine, you can format a
                    floppy on that machine.
                    Otherwise, use SSH or putty to log in to
                    IPCop as root, and issue the command there.
                    <span><b class="command">fdformat</b></span> will not prompt for a floppy
                    like DOS format will, so insert the floppy disk into the

            IPCop uses the Linux Netfilter or IPTables firewall
            facility to maintain a stateful firewall.
            Stateful firewalls keep track of connections to and
            from all GREEN, BLUE and ORANGE network IP addresses,
            based on both the source and destination IP
            addresses and ports, as well as the state of the
            connection itself.
            After a connection is established involving protected
            machines, only packets consistent with the current
            state of the connection are allowed through the
            IPCop firewall.
        </p><p>
            The <span class="guilabel">IPTables Connection Tracking</span>
            window shows the IPTables connections.
            Connection end points are color-coded based on their
            network location.
            The color-coding legend is displayed at the top of
            the page.
            Information on individual connections is displayed
            next.
            Each connection from or to your networks is shown.

        This subsection of the Dialup Administration Window
        (AW) is divided into 5 different editable sections and
        is only applicable if you are accessing the Internet
        using an analog modem, an ISDN device or a DSL
        connection.
        </p><p>
        Note that you cannot select or modify a profile while
        the IPCop server is online, or waiting to go online in
        &#8220;<span class="quote">Dial on Demand</span>&#8221;
        mode. Before using this page, go to the
        <span class="guilabel">Home</span> AW and if the status line
        reports <span class="guilabel">Connected</span> or <span class="guilabel">
        Dial on Demand waiting</span> then the click on
        the <span class="guibutton">Disconnect</span> button before
        returning to this Window. After setting up or
        selecting Profiles, remember to return to the
        <span class="guilabel">Home</span> AW and click the
        <span class="guibutton">Connect</span> button, if you want your
        IPCop server to go back online.
        </p><p><b><span class="guilabel">Profiles </span>. </b>
        This section of the Window provides the facilities to
        name and set up new Dialup Profiles (up to a total of
        five), or to rename existing Profiles and change their
        parameters.
        </p><p>
        Select a Profile to be created or modified from the
        drop-down list. Fill in or change the parameters for
        the profile (see below) and click on the
        <span class="guibutton">Save</span> button. To select the

        <span class="guibutton">Restore</span> button while editing a Profile to
        reinstate the previous Profile settings.
        </p><p><b><span class="guilabel">Telephony </span>. </b>
        This section allows
        you to do the following:
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Select the appropriate
            <span class="guilabel">Interface</span>  for your Internet connection
            device. This will be either a Communications port
            (COM1 - COM4) used mostly for modems and ISDN
            cards, or PPPoE which is used mostly for DSL
            connections.
            </p></li><li><p>Select the appropriate <span class="guilabel">
            Computer to modem rate</span>. This will
            decide how quickly data is passed to and from your
            connection device. With older computer systems or
            modems, you may find it necessary to use one of
            the lower data rates to establish reliable
            computer/ modem communications.
            </p></li><li><p>Enter the correct <span class="guilabel">Number
            </span> to dial for your Internet connection.
            If connecting through the PPPoE interface then
            chances are you will probably be leaving this
            blank.
            </p></li><li><p>Select whether or not the <span class="guilabel">
            Modem speaker on</span>. Having the speaker on
            allows you to hear the connection taking place and
            can be a useful diagnostic aid when
            troubleshooting. This option is only likely to be
            useful if you are connecting via an analog modem.
            </p></li><li><p>Select your <span class="guilabel"> Dialing mode
            </span>. Use Tone dialing unless your
            telephone connection only recognizes Pulse
            dialing. Pulse dialing is a lot slower than Tone
            dialing.
            </p></li><li><p>Enter your desired <span class="guilabel">Maximum
            retries</span>. This will decide how often
            IPCop attempts to connect to the Internet after a
            failed connection attempt.
            </p></li><li><p>Enter your <span class="guilabel"> Idle timeout
            </span>. This will decide how IPCop handles
            your Internet connection when nothing is actually
            being sent or received via the Internet
            connection. The number you enter here indicates to
            IPCop how long it should wait after any Internet
            activity before it disconnects the modem link. If
            you set this parameter to <span class="guilabel">0
            </span> then IPCop, once connected, will not
            disconnect from the Internet of its own accord.
            </p></li><li><p>The
            <span class="guilabel">Persistent Connection</span>
            checkbox is used to instruct IPCop to
            maintain the modem connection at all times, even
            in the absence of Internet activity. In this mode
            it will attempt to reconnect the Internet
            connection whenever the link fails for any reason,
            such as a connection time-out at the ISP end of
            the modem link. Use this mode with caution. If you
            have metered connection charges you probably will
            not want to use this feature. However, if you have
            unlimited service time (often called "Flatrate")
            with your ISP, you may want to use this in order
            to keep the link connected as much as possible.
            Note that in
            <span class="guilabel">Persistent</span>
            mode, IPCop will cease reconnecting
            after more than the number of consecutive failed
            dial attempts set in
            <span class="guilabel">Maximum Retries</span>

            In this event, you have to use
            the
            <span class="guibutton">Dial</span>
            button
            on the
            <span class="guilabel">Home</span> AW.
        </p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Dial on Demand</span> is
            available by clicking the checkbox. Note that
            after enabling Dial on Demand, you still have to
            click the <span class="guibutton">Connect</span> button on the <span class="guilabel">
            Home</span> AW before IPCop will start
            connecting automatically when it detects Internet
            activity. The <span class="guilabel">Dial on Demand
            </span> option is not available for PPPoE
            connections.
            </p></li><li><p>The <span class="guilabel">Dial on
            Demand for DNS</span> option determines
            whether IPCop will connect automatically when it
            detects DNS requests. This will be usually what
            you will want to happen.
            </p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">Connect on IPCop Restart
            </span> will make IPCop connect after booting,
            if <span class="guilabel">Dial on Demand</span>
            is not selected. You will probably want to set
            this option as active if you are also using
            <span class="guilabel">Dial on Demand</span>.
            This is because the combination of settings will
            automatically put the IPCop system into Dial on
            Demand waiting mode each time the IPCop server is
            switched on or rebooted.
            </p></li><li><p><span class="guilabel">ISP Requires Carriage Return
            </span> Some ISPs require that the modem
            sends a carriage return to signal to indicate that
            it is finished sending data. If your ISP requires
            this, then leave it checked. If not then you can
            uncheck this box. The default is checked.
            </p></li></ol></div><p>
        <span class="guilabel">Additional PPPoE settings</span> - If
        either PPPoE  or USB ADSL is enabled, additional
        configuration options are available. Here you can
        enter two additional parameters, a service name, and a
        concentrator name, which some ISPs require. If your
        ISP does not require them, or does not give you any,
        then you may leave these two fields blank. Your ISP
        will give you two settings, VPI and VCI, which you
        must enter if you are using a USB ADSL connection.
        </p><p><b><span class="guilabel">Authentication</span>. </b><span class="guilabel">Username</span> and <span class="guilabel">
        Password</span> are the username and password that
        your ISP should have supplied to you when you opened
        your account with them. There are several ways in
        which ISPs use this username and password to login to
        their systems. The most common methods are PAP or
        CHAP. Select this if your ISP uses either of those
        two. If your ISP uses a text-based login script,
        choose standard login script. For people in the UK who
        use Demon Internet as their ISP, a special script has
        been created for them to use. The "Other" login script
        option has been provided for people who have ISPs with
        special needs. If you need to do this, you will need
        to login to the IPCop box and create a file in
        /etc/ppp. This filename (without the /etc/ppp
        component) should be entered into the Script name box.
        The file contains 'expect send' pairs, separated by a
        tab.
        <i class="parameter"><tt>USERNAME</tt></i> will
        be substituted for the username and
        <i class="parameter"><tt>PASSWORD</tt></i> for the
        password. Examine
        the file demonloginscript in /etc/ppp, and use it as
        an example of what should be in this file.
        </p><p><b><span class="guilabel">DNS</span>. </b>
        Select <span class="guilabel">Automatic</span>
        if your ISP supports
        automatic DNS server configuration, as is now usually
        the case. The alternative is to leave
        <span class="guilabel">Automatic</span> unticked and put IP
        addresses in the <span class="guilabel">Primary DNS
        </span> and <span class="guilabel">Secondary DNS
        </span> boxes. These IP addresses will generally
        be provided where necessary by your ISP.

        by all means change it.

        <span class="guilabel">Tone Dial</span> - The standard Tone
        Dial string used by most Hayes-compatible modems is
        already provided for you in this field. If your modem
        and telephone line can support the Tone Dial feature
        and you are experiencing problems connecting then make
        sure that this string is appropriate for use with your
        modem.
        </p><p>
        <span class="guilabel">Pulse Dial</span> - The standard Pulse
        Dial string used by most Hayes-compatible modems is
        already provided for you in this field. You should not
        need to change it, but if your telephone service does
        not support Tone Dialing then you may need to make
        sure this is the correct string for your modem.
        </p><p>
        The only section in this area that may not be blank is
        the Connect Timeout. This tells IPCop the amount of
        time to allow the modem to attempt to connect. After
        this number of seconds has elapsed without proper
        response on the receiving end, IPCop will give up and
        move on to the next connection attempt. The default
        should work fine for you but if you notice that the
        connection is being dropped in the middle of the
        negotiation sequence (turn on the modem speaker and
        listen to the attempted connection) then you may need
        to increase this parameter slightly until it connects
        successfully.

            A web proxy server is a program that makes requests for web pages on behalf
            of all the other machines on your intranet. The proxy server will cache the pages
            it retrieves from the web so that if 3 machines request the same page only one
            transfer from the Internet is required. If your organization has a number of commonly
            used web sites this can save on Internet accesses.
        </p><p>
            Normally you must configure the web browsers used on your network to use the proxy server
            for Internet access. You should set the name/address of the proxy to that of the IPCop machine
            and the port to the one you have entered into the <span class="guibutton">Proxy Port</span> box, default 800.
            This configuration allows browsers to bypass the proxy if they wish. It
            is also possible to run the proxy in &#8220;<span class="quote">transparent</span>&#8221; mode. In this case the browsers
            need no special configuration and the firewall automatically redirects all traffic on port 80,
            the standard HTTP port, to the proxy server.
        </p><p>
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/proxy.png" align="middle" alt="HTTP Proxy Web Page"></div></div><p>
        </p><p>
            You can choose if you want to proxy requests from your Green (private) network
            and/or your Blue (wireless) network. Just tick the relevant boxes.
        </p><p>
            If you choose to enable the proxy then you can also log web accesses by ticking the
            <span class="guibutton">Log Enabled</span> box. Accesses made through the proxy can be seen by
            clicking the Proxy Logs choice of the Logs menu.
        </p><p>
            If your ISP requires you to use their cache for web access then you should specify the hostname and port
            in the <span class="guibutton">Upstream proxy</span> text box. If your ISP's proxy requires a user name
            and password then enter them in the <span class="guibutton">Upstream username</span> and
            <span class="guibutton">Upstream password</span> boxes.
        </p><p><a name="cache_management"></a><b>Cache Management. </b>
            You can choose how much disk space should be used for caching web pages in the Cache Management section.
            You can also set the size of the smallest object to be cached, normally 0, and the largest, 4096KB.
            For privacy reasons, the proxy will not cache pages received via https, or other pages
            where a username and password are submitted via the URL.
            </p><p><a name="transfer_limits"></a><b>Transfer limits. </b>
            The web proxy can also be used to control how your users access the web. The only control accessible via the
            web interface is the maximum size of data received from and sent to the web. You can use this to
            prevent your users
            downloading large files and slowing Internet access for everyone else. Set these to 0,the default, to remove
            all restrictions.
            </p><p>
            To save any changes, press the <span class="guibutton">Save </span>button.
        </p><p>
            You can flush all pages out of the proxy cache at any time by clicking the
            <span class="guibutton">Clear Cache </span>button.
        </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
                Caching can take up a lot of space on your hard drive.  If you use a large cache, then the
                minimum size hard drive listed in the IPCop documentation will not be large enough.</p><p>
                The larger the cache you choose the more memory is required by the proxy server to manage the cache. If
                you are running IPCop on a machine with low memory do not choose a large cache.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="services_dhcp"></a>DHCP Administrative Web Page</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) allows you to control the network configuration of all your computers
            or devices from your IPCop machine. When a computer (or a device like a printer, pda, etc.) joins your network it will be given a valid IP address
            and its DNS and WINS configuration will be set from the IPCop machine. To use this feature
            new machines must be set to obtain their network configuration automatically.

                            You can specify the lowest and highest addresses that the server will hand out to
                            other requestors. The default is to hand out all the addresses within the subnet you set
                            up when you installed IPCop. If you have machines on your network that do not use
                            DHCP, and have their IP addresses set manually, you should set the start and end
                            address so that the server will not hand out any of these manual IPs.
                        </p><p>
                            You should also make sure that any addresses listed in the fixed lease section (see below)

                            The default lease time is the time interval IP
                            address leases are good for.
                            Before, the lease time for an address expires your
                            computers will request a renewal of their lease,
                            specifying their current IP address.
                            If DHCP parameters have been changed, when a lease

                            Generally, leases are renewed by the server.

                            The maximum lease time is the time interval during
                            which the DHCP server will always honor client

                            may be changed by the server.
                            If the dynamic IP address range has changed, the
                            server will hand out an IP address in the new

                            If any host name cannot be resolved, the client will

                            Many ISP's DHCP servers set the default
                            domain name
                            to their network and tell customers to get to the

            Dynamic DNS (DYNDNS) allows you to make your server available to the Internet
            even though it does not have a static IP address.
            To use DYNDNS you must first register a subdomain with a DYNDNS provider. Then
            whenever your server connects to the Internet and is given an IP address by your ISP
            it must inform the DYNDNS server of that IP address.
            When a client machine wishes to connect to your server it will resolve the address
            by going to the DYNDNS server, which will give it the latest value. If this is up to date
            then the client will be able to contact your server (assuming your firewall rules allow this).
            IPCop makes the process of keeping your DYNDNS address up to date easier by providing
            automatic updates for many of the DYNDNS providers.

                Although IPCop can act as a timeserver for your network, it uses the ntpdate program to update
                its time on a periodic basis instead of allowing the more accurate ntpd server to maintain
                the time continuously. This means that the IPCop clock is more likely to drift out of
                synchronisation with the real time but does not require that IPCop is permanently connected
                to the Internet.

                If you correct the time by a large amount, and offset the clock ahead of

             Traffic Shaping allows you to prioritize IP traffic moving through your firewall. IPCop uses
             WonderShaper to accomplish this.
             WonderShaper was designed to minimize ping latency, ensure that interactive traffic like
             SSH is responsive all while downloading or uploading bulk traffic.
         </p><p>
            </p><div class="figure-float"><div class="figure"><a name="v140.services.010"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 2.17. Traffic Shaping Settings</b></p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/wondershaper.png" align="middle" alt="Traffic Shaping Web Page"></div></div></div><p>
         </p><p>
             Many ISPs sell speed as download rates, not as latency.
             To maximize download speeds, they configure their equipment to hold large
             queues of your traffic.
             When interactive traffic is mixed into these large queues, their latency shoots way up,
             as ACK packets must wait in line before they reach you.
             IPCop takes matters into its own hands and prioritizes your traffic the way you want it.
             This is done by setting traffic into High, Medium and Low priority categories.
             Ping traffic always has the highest priority &#8212; to let you show off how fast your
             connection is while doing massive downloads.
         </p><p>
            To use Traffic Shaping in IPCop:
         </p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
                     Use well known fast sites to estimate your maximum upload and download speeds.
                     Fill in the speeds in the corresponding boxes of the
                     <span class="guilabel">Settings</span>
                     portion of the web page.
                 </p></li><li><p>
                    Enable traffic shaping by checking the <span class="guilabel">Enable</span> box.
                 </p></li><li><p>
                    Identify what services are used behind your firewall.
                 </p></li><li><p>
                    Then sort these into your 3 priority levels.
                    For example:
                 </p><ol type="a"><li><p>
                           Interactive traffic such as SSH (port 22) and VOIP (voice over IP) go into the high
                           priority group.
                        </p></li><li><p>
                           Your normal surfing and communicating traffic like the web (port 80) and streaming
                           video/audio to into the medium priority group.
                        </p></li><li><p>
                             Put your bulk traffic such as P2P file sharing into the low traffic group.
                        </p></li></ol></li><li><p>
                     Create a list of services and priorities using the
                     <span class="guilabel">Add service</span>
                     portion of the web page.
                 </p></li></ol></div><p>
             The services, above, are only examples of the potential Traffic Shaping configuration.
             Depending on your usage, you will undoubtedly want to rearrange your choices of
             high, medium and low priority traffic.

            </h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                Firewalls prevent externally initiated requests
                from accessing the protected system.
                However, sometimes, this is too strict a situation.
                For example, if one is running a web server, then
                any requests to that web server by users outside
                the protected network will be blocked by default.
                This means that only other users on the same
                internal network can use the web server.
                This is not the normal situation for web servers.
                Most people
                <span class="strong">want</span> outsiders
                to be able to access the server.
                This is where Port Forwarding comes in.
            </p><p>
                Port Forwarding is a service that allows limited
                access to the internal LANs from outside.
                When you set up your server, you can choose the
                receiving  or &#8220;<span class="quote">listening</span>&#8221; ports on the
                internal network machines.
                This is done differently depending on which software
                is being used.
                Please refer to the documentation that came with
                your servers to set up the ports on those servers.
            </p><p>
                Once those receiving ports are ready, you are ready
                to enter information into the AW on IPCop.
                The <span class="guilabel">TCP/UDP</span> drop down list
                allows you to choose which protocol this rule will
                follow.
                Most regular servers use TCP.
                Some game servers and chat servers use UDP.
                If the protocol is not specified in the server
                documentation, then it is usually TCP.
                <span class="guilabel">Source port</span> is the port to which
                the outsiders will connect.
                In most cases, this will be the standard port for the
                service being offered (80 for web servers,
                20 for FTP servers, 25 for mail servers, etc.)
                If you wish, you may specify a range of ports to
                forward.
                To specify a range use the &#8220;<span class="quote">:</span>&#8221; character
                between two port numbers, lowest number first.
                <span class="guilabel">Destination IP</span> is the internal
                IP address of the server (for example, you may have
                your web server on 192.168.0.3).
                <span class="guilabel">Destination Port</span> is the port that
                you chose when you set up your server in the first
                paragraph.
                The <span class="guilabel">SourceIP</span> dropdown menu
                allows you to choose which Red IP this rule will

                IPCop has the capability of handling more than one
                Red IP.
                If you only have one Red IP set up, then choose

                Port Forwarding and External Access
            </h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                The Port Forwarding interface was re-written for version 1.3.0.
                It is quite different from earlier versions. However, please
                note that the port numbers used for a particular service have
                not changed, and you should still refer to these above.
            </p><p>
                The External Access page has <span class="strong">NO</span>
                affect on the GREEN or ORANGE networks. It is there to allow
                you to open ports to the IPCop box itself and not the GREEN
                or ORANGE networks.
            </p><p>
                How do you open up external access then? It is combined into
                the Port Forward page - there is a field on the page labeled:
            </p><p>
                'Source IP, or network (blank for "ALL"):'
            </p><p>
                This is the field that controls external access - if you leave
                it BLANK, your port forward will be open to
                <span class="strong">ALL INTERNET ADDRESSES</span>.
                Alternatively if you put an address or network in there, it will
                be restricted to that network or Internet address.
            </p><p>
                </p><div class="figure-float"><div class="figure"><a name="v140.firewall.001"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 2.20. Port Forwarding Settings</b></p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/portfwd.png" align="middle" alt="Port Forwarding Web Page"></div></div></div><p>
            </p><p>
                You can have more than one external address - after you have
                created the port forward entry, it will appear in the table.
                If you wish to add another external address, click the Red
                Pencil with the Plus sign next to the entry, the entry screen
                at the top of the page will change (it will load values from
                the port forward) and allow you to enter an external IP
                address or network.
            </p><p>
                When added you will now notice that there is a new entry under
                the port forward in the table.
            </p><p>
                Other things to note:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
                        We support the GRE protocol.
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        You can have port ranges and wildcards. Valid wildcards
                        are:
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        * which translates to 1-65535
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        85-* which translates into 85-65535
                    </p></li><li><p>
                        *-500 which translates into 1-500
                    </p></li></ul></div><p>
                Valid characters to separate a port range are
                &#8220;<span class="quote">:</span>&#8221; or
                &#8220;<span class="quote">-</span>&#8221;.
                Note that - will be modified to
		a &#8220;<span class="quote">:</span>&#8221; even though it will be
                displayed as a &#8220;<span class="quote">-</span>&#8221; on the screen.
            </p><p>
                You only need to enter the first source port, the destination
                will be filled in for you.
            </p><p>
                You can edit a record by clicking on the Yellow Pencil icon in the
                Action column, and until you hit the update button,
                nothing changes and nothing is lost.
            </p><p>
                When you are editing a record, you will see the record
                highlighted in yellow.
            </p><p>
                To delete a record, click on the Trash Can icon on
                the right hand side of the Action column.
            </p><p>
                Ports ranges cannot overlap each other.
            </p><p>
                Individual ports cannot be placed in the middle of a range i.e.
                if you have 2000-3000 already set up and then try to forward
                port 2500, it will give you an error. You cannot forward the
                same port to several machines.
            </p><p>
                Reserved ports - on the main Red Address (DEFAULT IP) some
                ports are reserved for IPCop to do its business, they are 67,
                68, 81, 222, and 445.
            </p><p>
                When you edit a port forward, there will be an extra check
                box labeled 'Override external access to ALL'. This is used
                as a quick and dirty way to open a port to ALL Internet
                addresses for testing or whatever your reasons. This was a
                user request.
            </p><p>
                If you have a port forward with multiple external accesses,
                when you delete all of the external accesses, the port
                becomes open to ALL addresses, be careful of this one.
            </p><p>
                There is a Shortcut to enable or disable a port forward or
                external access - click on the &#8220;<span class="quote">Enabled</span>&#8221; icon
                (the checkbox in the Action column) for the particular
                entry you want to enable or disable.
                The icon changes to an empty box when a rule is
                disabled. Click on the checkbox to enable it again.
                <span class="strong">Note:</span> when you disable

        </p><p>
            From v1.3.0 onwards, External Access only controls access
            to the IPCop box. It has no affect on the Green, Blue or
            Orange network access. That is now controlled in the Port
            Forwarding section, see above.
        </p><p>
            If you wish to maintain your IPCop machine remotely, you
            should specify TCP port 445, https.
            If you have enabled ssh access, you can also enable TCP
            port 222, ssh.
        </p><p>
            The <span class="guilabel">TCP/UDP</span> drop down list allows
            you to choose which protocol this rule will follow.
            Most regular servers use TCP.
            If the protocol is not specified in the server
            documentation, then it is usually TCP.
            <span class="guilabel">Source IP</span> is the IP address of an
            external machine you give permission to access your
            firewall.
            You may leave this blank, which allows any IP address to
            connect.
            Although dangerous, this is useful if you want to
            maintain your machine from anywhere in the world.
            However, if you can limit the IP addresses for remote
            maintenance, the IP addresses of those machines or networks
            that are allowed access, should be listed in this box.
            <span class="guilabel">Destination Port</span> is the external

            The <span class="guilabel">Destination IP</span> dropdown menu allows
            you to choose which Red IP this rule will affect.
            IPCop has the capability of handling more than one Red IP.

        </p><p>
            A DMZ or Demilitarized Zone (Orange zone) is used as a semi-safe
            interchange point between the external Red Zone and the
            internal Green zone.
            The Green zone has all your internal machines.
            The Red zone is the Internet at large.
            The DMZ allows them to share servers without allowing
            undue access to the internal LAN by those in the Red Zone.
        </p><p>
            For example, suppose that your business has a web server.
            Certainly, you want your customers (those in the Red zone)
            to be able to access it.
            But suppose you also want your web server to be able to
            send customer orders to employees in the Green Zone?
            In a traditional firewall setup, this wouldn't work,
            because the request for access to the Green zone would be
            initiating from outside the Green zone.
            You certainly do not want to give all your customers
            direct access to the machines on the Green side, so how
            can this work?
            By using the DMZ and DMZ pinholes.
        </p><p>
            DMZ pinholes give machines in the Orange (DMZ) zone
            limited access to certain ports on Green machines.
            Because servers (the machines in the Orange zone) have to
            have relaxed rules with respect to the Red zone, they are
            more susceptible to hacking attacks.
            By only allowing limited access from Orange to Green,
            this will help to prevent unauthorized access to
            restricted areas should your server be compromised.
        </p><p>
            The <span class="guilabel">TCP/UDP</span> drop down list allows you to choose which protocol this

        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
                    Use a supported Ethernet card to setup the Blue interface.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    Connect an Access Point to that Ethernet card. (Use the LAN
                    Ethernet port on the AP, if you have a choice of ports).
                </p></li><li><p>
                    You can use DHCP to serve dynamic or static addresses on
                    Blue, although static is preferred for security of MAC addresses.
                    Refer to the <a href="#services_dhcp" title="DHCP Administrative Web Page">DHCP Server</a>
                    section for more information on configuring static leases.

            If you only need to provide access for http traffic on the Blue network to

            are using an Access Point, via the web page shown below.
        </p><p>
            An Access Point behaves like an Ethernet hub, and IPCop serves out DHCP
            leases through it to wireless devices. A Wireless Router does NAT, serves
            out DHCP on it's own subnet, and has it's own access controls.
        </p><p>
            You will be able to view
            IPCop's web interface from a computer on the Blue network, but you
            will not be able to connect to the Green network without some additional
            work.
        </p><p>

            Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
        </h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            Virtual Private Networks or VPNs allow two networks to connect
            directly to each other over another network such as the Internet.
            All data is transmitted securely over an encrypted tunnel, hidden
            from prying eyes.
            Similarly, a single computer can also connect to another network
            using the same facilities.
            One of the protocols used to create VPNs is known as IPSec.
        </p><p>
            IPCop can easily establish VPNs between other IPCop servers.
            IPCop can also inter-operate with just about any
            VPN product that supports IPSec and standard encryption
            technologies such as 3DES.
            VPN connections in IPCop are defined as Net-to-Net or Host-to-Net.
            This is 100% optional, so you may safely ignore this section
            if you do not wish to make use of this feature.
        </p><p>
            Most modern operating systems have support for IPSec.
            This includes Windows, Macintosh OSX, Linux and most
            Unix variants.
            Unfortunately, the tools needed to provide this support vary
            greatly and may be difficult to set up.
        </p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="net_to_net_intro"></a>Net-to-Net</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                Net-to-net VPNs link two or more private networks across the
                Internet, by creating an IPSec &#8220;<span class="quote">tunnel</span>&#8221;.
                In a net-to-net VPN, at least one of the networks involved must
                be connected to the Internet with an IPCop firewall.
                The other network can be connected to an IPCop firewall, or
                another IPSec enabled router or firewall.
                These router/firewalls have public IP addresses assigned
                by an ISP and are most likely to be using Network Address
                Translation, hence the term Net-to-Net.
            </p><p>
                If desired, a VPN can be created between wireless machines
                on your BLUE network and an IPCop firewall.
                This ensures that traffic on your BLUE network cannot be
                intercepted with wireless sniffers.
            </p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="host_to_net_intro"></a>Host-to-Net</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                A Host-to-Net connection is where IPCop is at one end of
                the VPN tunnel and a remote or mobile user is on the other end.
                The mobile user is most likely to be a laptop user with a
                dynamic public IP address assigned by an ISP,
                hence the terms Host-to-Net or Roadwarrior.
            </p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="authentication_intro"></a>Methods of Authentication</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            It is necessary to have a pre-shared key/password/pass phrase or an
            X.509 certificate before trying to
            configure a Roadwarrior or Net-to-Net VPN connection.
            These are methods of authentication, which identify the
            user trying to access the VPN.
            They will be required in the VPN configuration stage.
        </p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="psk_intro"></a>Pre-shared Key</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
                The pre-shared key authentication method or PSK
                is a very simple method that allows VPN
                connections to be set up quickly.
                For this method, you enter an authentication phrase.
                This can be any character string &#8212; similar to a
                password.
                This phrase must be available for authentication on IPCop and
                to the VPN client.
            </p><p>
                The PSK method involves fewer steps than certificate authentication.
                It can be used to test connectivity of a VPN and to become
                familiar with the procedure of establishing a VPN connection.
                Experienced users may wish to progress straight to
                <a href="#create_CA_cert" title="Creating IPCop's Certificates">generating a certificate of

                a net-to-net VPN connection.
            </p><p>
                The pre-shared key method should not be used with
                Roadwarrior connections as all roadwarriors must use the
                same pre-shared key.

                X.509 certificates are a very secure way of connecting VPN
                servers.
                To implement X.509 certificates you must either generate or
                setup up the certificates on IPCop or use another certification
                authority on your network.
            </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">X.509 Terminology</h3><p>
                    X.509 certificates on IPCop and many other implementations
                    are manipulated and controlled by OpenSSL.
                    SSL, or the Secure Sockets Layer, has its own terminology.
                </p><p>
                    X.509 certificates, depending on their type, may contain public and
                    private encryption keys, pass phrases and information about the
                    entity they refer to.
                    These certificates are meant to be validated by Certification
                    Authorities (Certificate Authorities) or CAs.
                    When used by web browsers, the CA certificates of major, pay for, CAs
                    are compiled into the browsers.
                    To validate a host certificate, the certificate is passed to the appropriate
                    CA to perform validation.
                    On private networks or unique hosts, the CA may reside on a local host.
                    In IPCop's case, this is the IPCop firewall, itself.
                </p><p>
                    Certification requests are requests for X.509 certificates that are passed
                    to CAs.
                    The CAs in turn generate an X.509 certificate by signing the request.
                    These are returned to the requesting entity as X.509 certificates.
                    This certificate will be known to the CA, since it signed it.
                </p><p>
                    You will see that X.509 certificates and requests can be stored on
                    your hard drive in three different formats, usually identified by their
                    extensions.
                    PEM format is the default for OpenSSL.
                    It can contain all the information associated with certificates in printable
                    format.
                    DER format contains just the key information and not any extra X.509
                    information.
                    This is the default format for most browsers.
                    PEM format wraps headers around DER format keys.
                    PKCS#12, PFK or P12 certificates contain the same information
                    as PEM files in binary format.
                    Using the <span><b class="command">openssl</b></span> command,
                    PEM and PKCS#12 files can
                    be transformed into their opposite number.
                </p></div><p>
                To use a certificate, you must import it into the other
                side's CA, too.
                The IPSec implementation on IPCop contains its own built in CA.
                CAs may run on roadwarrior's machines, also.
            </p><p>
                If the roadwarrior's IPSec implementation does not have CA
                capabilities, you can generate a certificate request, import it into IPCop
                so that IPCop's CA can sign it, export the resulting certificate
                and import it into the originating road warrior's IPSec software.

          If desired, you can generate several root and host certificates on a
          single IPCop, and then export them to PKCS12 format files, encrypted
          with a password.
          You can then email them as attachments to your other sites.
          Using the

                IPSec uses the terms
                <span class="emphasis"><em>right</em></span> and
                <span class="emphasis"><em>left</em></span> for the two sides of a connection or
                tunnel.
                These terms have no real meaning.
                IPSec will orient itself based on network addresses and routes.
                Once it determines which network connection, left or right, to use to
                get to the other side of a connection, all other right or left parameters
                follow.
                Many folks use left for the local side of a connection and right
                for the remote side.
                This is not necessary.
                It is best to think of the terms as &#8220;<span class="quote">side 1</span>&#8221; and
                &#8220;<span class="quote">side A</span>&#8221; of an old LP record.

            <span class="guilabel">Authentication</span>
        </h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
            The second section of the web page deals with authentication.
            In other words, this is how this IPCop will make sure the tunnel
            established by both sides of the interface is talking to its opposite
            number.
            IPCop has made every effort to support both PSKs and X.509
            certificates.
            There are four mutually exclusive choices that can be used to
            authenticate a connection.
        </p><p><b><span class="guilabel">Use a Pre-Shared Key</span>. </b>
                Enter a pass phrase to be used to authenticate the other side
                of the tunnel.
                Chose this if you wish a simple Net-to-Net VPN.
                You can also use PSKs while experimenting in setting up a VPN.
                <span class="emphasis"><em>
                    Do not use PSKs to authenticate tunnels to roadwarriors.
                </em></span>
            </p><p><b><span class="guilabel">Upload certificate request</span>. </b>
                Some roadwarrior IPSec implementations do not have their
                own CA.
                If they wish to use IPSec's built in CA, they can generate
                what is called a certificate request.
                This is a partial X.509 certificate that must be signed by CA to
                be a complete certificate.
                During certificate request upload, the request is signed and the
                new certificate will become available on the VPNs main web page.
            </p><p><b><span class="guilabel">Upload a certificate</span>. </b>
                In this case, the peer IPSec has a CA available for use.
                Both the peer's CA certificate and host certificate must
                be uploaded.
            </p><p><b>
                <span class="guilabel">Generate a certificate</span>
            . </b>
                In this case, the IPSec peer will be able to provide an X.509
                certificate, but lacks the capacity to even generate a certificate
                request.
                In this case, complete the required fields.
                Optional fields are indicated by blue dots.
                If this certificate is for a Net-to-Net connection, the
                <span class="guilabel">
                    User's Full Name or System Hostname
                </span>
                field may need to be the Internet fully qualified domain name
                of the peer.
                The optional organization name is meant to isolate different portions
                of an organization from access to IPCop's full GREEN network
                by subnetting the <span class="guilabel">Local Subnet</span> in the connection
                definition portion of this web page.
                The
                <span class="guilabel">PKCS12 File Password</span>
                fields ensure that the host certificates generated cannot be intercepted
                and compromised while being transmitted to the IPSec peer.

                Not all denied packets are hostile attempts by
                crackers to gain access to your machine. Blocked
                packets commonly occur for a number of harmless
                reasons and many can be safely ignored. Among these
                may be attempted connections to the "ident/auth" port
                (113), which are blocked by default in IPCop.

        </p><p>
            The <span class="guilabel">Log:</span> section of this
            page contains an entry for each of the packets that
            were "dropped" by the firewall. Included is the time
            of the event, the Source and Destination IP addresses
            and ports for the dropped packet, the protocol used
            for that packet, and the IPCop Chain and Interface
            involved.
        </p><p>
            You can obtain information about the listed IP addresses
            by clicking on an IP Address. IPCop performs a DNS lookup
            and reports any available information about its registration
            and ownership.

            This page shows incidents detected by the IPCop
            Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The IDS system is
            inactive after first installation of IPCop, and may be
            activated (and deactivated) through a specific
            administration page (<span class="guimenu">Services</span> &gt;
            <span class="guimenu">Intrusion Detection</span>).
        </p><p>

            are described in detail at the beginning of this
            Section. These allow you to examine the IDS Logs for a
            specific day. These Logs consist of a number of items
            for each detected incident:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The <span class="guilabel">Date:</span> and time of

            identities (address &amp; port) of the source and
            target involved in the incident. Each IP address
            is a hyperlink, which you can use to perform a DNS
            lookup for that IP address and obtain any
            available information about its registration and

            number (if available). "Snort" is the software
            module used by IPCop to provide the IDS function,
            and SID is the ID code used by the Snort module to
            identify a particular pattern of attack. This
            parameter is hyperlinked to a web page carrying

            We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals

            A &#8220;<span class="quote">Secondary Section</span>&#8221; is a named appendix or a
            front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with
            the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to
            the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and
            contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
            subject.
            (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
            a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
            The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with

            under this License.
            If a
            section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
            allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero

            that is suitable for revising the document
            straightforwardly with generic text editors
            or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
            drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
            suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation
            to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters.
            A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
            markup, or absence of markup,
            has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
            by readers is not Transparent.
            An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
            of text.
            A copy that is not &#8220;<span class="quote">Transparent</span>&#8221; is called
            &#8220;<span class="quote">Opaque</span>&#8221;.
        </p><p>
            Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
            plain ASCII without markup,
            Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a
            publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF
            designed for human modification.
            Examples of
            transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
            Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
            can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
            or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
            generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
            produced by
            some word processors for output purposes only.
        </p><p>
            The &#8220;<span class="quote">Title Page</span>&#8221; means, for a printed book, the
            title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
            hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in
            the title page.
            For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
            &#8220;<span class="quote">Title Page</span>&#8221; means the text near the most prominent
            appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning
            of the body of the text.
        </p><p>
            A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
            title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
            text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
            specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
            "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
            of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
            section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
        </p><p>
            The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
            states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
            Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
            License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
            implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
            no effect on the meaning of this License.

            You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
            either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
            License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying
            this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all
            copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to
            those of this License.
            You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
            reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
            However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.
            If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also
            follow the conditions in
            <a href="#quantity" title="3. Copying In Quantity">section 3</a>.
        </p><p>
            You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
            above, and you may publicly display copies.

            If you publish printed copies
            (or copies in media that commonly have
            printed covers)
            of the Document, numbering more
            than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover
            Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry,
            clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts
            on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.
            Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
            publisher of these copies.
            The front cover must present the full title with all words of
            the title equally prominent and visible.
            You may add other material on the covers in addition.
            Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
            preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
            conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
        </p><p>
            If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
            fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as
            fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest
            onto adjacent pages.
        </p><p>
            If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
            numbering more than 100, you must either include a
            machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,
            or state in or with each Opaque copy a
            computer-network location
            from which the general
            network-using public has access to download
            using public-standard network protocols
            a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
            If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
            prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
            quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain
            thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year
            after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
            through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
            public.
        </p><p>
            It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
            authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
            number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
            updated version of the Document.
