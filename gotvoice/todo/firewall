The IP Tables state module can allow ICMP error messages for an existing connection by using the RELATED keyword after the --state option:
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

If you can't or don't want to use the state module, you can allow the required ICMP packets manually.

For IP Tables to pass destination unreachable, fragmentation needed but don't fragment bit set ICMP messages, execute the following command for each active chain. Replace CHAIN-NAME by the name of your chain.
iptables -I CHAIN-NAME -p ICMP --icmp-type 3/4 -j ACCEPT
