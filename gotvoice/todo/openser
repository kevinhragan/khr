tcpdump how sip works now:
   rtp traffic; does it go thru asterisk
   sdp content

openser
   first get something working
   firewall:
       nathelper 
       rtpproxy
   later: dispatcher
 
first get something working:
	sip phone calls openser or nat-ignrant asterisk calls openser
        openser calls sip gateway


Think about, research: load issues of running traffic
thru single operser box versus single asterisk
