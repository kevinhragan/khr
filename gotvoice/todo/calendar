from zimbra forum:
to see the free/busy for other zimbra users, you need to set the IFB search url. This is set in outlook by going to
tools->options->calendar options->free/busy options
and setting search location to
http(s)://<your-server>/service/pubcal/freebusy.ifb?acct=%name%@%server%
SSL won't work unless you have a valid certificate. If outlook has errors with IFB lookups, entries are written to the event log.

works:
