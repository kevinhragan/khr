			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bush years have increasingly worried me that our political system has entered into terminal old age, where members of a self-perpetuating ruling elite become fixated on their perks and privileges while utterly losing touch with the rest of the country.  There is <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?p=89">plenty of evidence</a> this is the case, and historically when this happens elsewhere the result is national decline.</p>
<p>Last night&#8217;s debate between Obama and Clinton, organized by ABC, is further evidence of a nation increasingly brain dead at the top.   There has been considerable discussion of how poor and corrupt <font size="2">George Stephanopoulus and Charlie Gibson were in their &#8220;moderation&#8221; of the debate, and the points made against them are completely valid so far as I can tell. Their performance is yet another example of why mainstream media should never be owned by corporations.  For more on this subject, see <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?p=115">here,</a>  <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?p=94">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?p=28">here.</a><br />
</font></p>
<p><a id="more-116"></a></p>
<p>I want to make another point: the moral depravity of these men.  I will pick on Stephanopolous, but Gibson could be used as well.  Stephanopolous asked Senator Obama:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator, two questions. Number one, do you think Reverend Wright loves America as much as you do?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
<p style="text-align: left">Obama has already answered any substantive issues regarding Rev. Wright in his famous speech on race in America.  But I want to focus here on the moral vacuity of the fatuous overpaid twerp, George Stephanopolous. On April 3, 2008,  Lawrence Korb and Ian Moss <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-oped0404wrightapr03,0,225570.story">wrote </a>in the Chicago Tribune:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px"><em class="dropcap_large" />In 1961, a young African-American man, after hearing President John F. Kennedy&#8217;s challenge to, &#8220;Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country,&#8221; gave up his student deferment, left college in Virginia and voluntarily joined the Marines.</p>
<p>In 1963, this man, having completed his two years of service in the Marines, volunteered again to become a Navy corpsman. (They provide medical assistance to the Marines as well as to Navy personnel.)</p>
<p>The man did so well in corpsman school that he was the valedictorian and became a cardiopulmonary technician. Not surprisingly, he was assigned to the Navy&#8217;s premier medical facility, Bethesda Naval Hospital, as a member of the commander in chief&#8217;s medical team, and helped care for President Lyndon B. Johnson after his 1966 surgery. For his service on the team, which he left in 1967, the White House awarded him three letters of commendation.</p>
<p>What is even more remarkable is that this man entered the Marines and Navy not many years after the two branches began to become integrated.</p>
<p>While this young man was serving six years on active duty, Vice President Dick Cheney, who was born the same year as the Marine/sailor, received five deferments, four for being an undergraduate and graduate student and one for being a prospective father. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, both five years younger than the African-American youth, used their student deferments to stay in college until 1968. Both then avoided going on active duty through family connections.</p>
<p>Who is the real patriot? The young man who interrupted his studies to serve his country for six years or our three political leaders who beat the system? Are the patriots the people who actually sacrifice something or those who merely talk about their love of the country?</p>
<p>After leaving the service of his country, the young African-American finished his final year of college, entered the seminary, was ordained as a minister, and eventually became pastor of a large church in one of America&#8217;s biggest cities.</p>
<p>This man is Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the retiring pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ. . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">I have never argued one must have served to love one&#8217;s country.  I did not serve, and I love my country.  Not mindlessley, but not lightly, either.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">But there is something obscene for men like Stephanopolous to question the love of country of men like Jeremiah Wright.  To Stephanopolous&#8217;s moral depravity we can add the rankest hypocrisy, for Rev. Wright&#8217;s words were in no way more disparaging of our country than those of many right wing preachers whose endorsement is actively sought by the media&#8217;s political huggy bear, John McCain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">Taken as a whole, America&#8217;s top elite seems bereft of morality, decency, shame, and competence.  One of the promises of democracy is that voting can ultimately eliminate such parasites peacefully.  Working in the other ways is the tendency of elites to try and insulate themselves from any challenges to their position, no matter how incompetent they become.  I have no idea whether democracy will prove up to the job today, or whether we are in the initial stages of a long term decline in the vitality and well-bei8ng of America.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Courtesy of Glenn Greenwald at Salon, we find that the corporate media has reported on the major issues facing Americans with the following <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/04/05/media/index.html">emphasis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the past two weeks, the following events transpired. A Department of Justice memo, authored by John Yoo, was released which authorized torture and presidential lawbreaking. It was revealed that the Bush administration declared the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights to be inapplicable to &#8220;domestic military operations&#8221; within the U.S. The U.S. Attorney General appears to have fabricated a key event leading to the 9/11 attacks and made patently false statements about surveillance laws and related lawsuits. Barack Obama went bowling in Pennsylvania and had a low score.</p>
<p>Here are the number of times, according to NEXIS, that various topics have been mentioned in the media over the past thirty days:</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Yoo and torture&#8221;</u> - 102</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Mukasey and 9/11&#8243;</u> &#8212; 73</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Yoo and Fourth Amendment&#8221;</u> &#8212; 16</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Obama and bowling&#8221;</u> &#8212; 1,043</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Obama and Wright&#8221;</u> &#8212; More than 3,000 (too many to be counted)</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Obama and patriotism&#8221;</u> - 1,607</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Clinton and Lewinsky&#8221;</u> &#8212; 1,079</p></blockquote>
<p>If there were not already ample reasons why corporations should be banned forever from owning media outlets in a free society, this record of treason against the American public should be sufficient for even the most doctrinaire free market advocate.</p>
<p>A corporation is incapable of human values or awareness.  It only seeks money.  When the media is highly concentrated,  as it is, the problem becomes even worse because the companies that own the news outlets also own many other potentially profitable vehntures and subordinate the news to those interests as well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will appreciate it if anyone has thoughtful criticisms of the following.  Ideologues unconcerned with actual events need not waste their (and my) time.</p>
<p>We have seen that Wall Street has both helped itself to enormously disproportionate incomes due to their capacity to game the system and that they have made themselves so essential to us that we are taxed to bail them out.  This is hardly the first time.  Under Ronald Reagan the Savings and Loan industry was bailed out for incompetently losing billions.</p>
<p>As then so now, the middle class and poor are paying so the ultra rich can game the system to socialize the risks they take while privatizing the gains.  The Bush family is an excellent example, Neil Bush being as incompetent a businessman as his presidential brother, losing billions, and being bailed out so he can continue living in unarned luxury.</p>
<p>There has never been a stronger argument for a highly graduated income tax.  I think a person can get by in comfort on a disposable annual income of, say, $1 million.  Does anyone really need more?  There should be generous allowances for charitable giving because individuals can often do better than the government – and such allowances enable them to help others they otherwise might not.  But for the take-it-all-home types, nail them.</p>
<p>Libertarians and conservatives will scream this is unfair – taking away people’s rewards for taking risks and succeeding.</p>
<p>In a perfect world where the rich do not consistently game the system in their favor their point could still be contested for reasons too complex for a blog discussion, but it would be stronger than it is. In the world we actually have their argument is naïve at best, willfully blind at worst.</p>
<p>I will focus on reasons rooted in the world we actually have</p>
<p>First – simple justice.  The corporate and financial rich in particular have gamed the legal and economic system for a long time, using the power of government to take from others for their personal benefit.  In self-defense we need to reduce their incentives to rob us.  If they can keep less wealth they have fewer incentives to use the government to give them more.</p>
<p>Second – the bankers and their kind tell us their industries are too important to the economy to fail.  They demand special privileges as a result.  If they are too important, and so need the privileges, those running them should not be allowed to use their positions to enrich themselves disproportionately.  The price of being protected is not being able to take advantage of your privileged position.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we should break up any and all such businesses because a free society cannot allow any business to become that important.</p>
<p>I have real sympathy for the most creative entrepreneurs and creative geniuses.  They should be able to make a very good living.  But for them money is not the only pay off, unlike many of those in the financial industry.  But even after the New Deal, when our tax system was at its most progressive, there was no shortage of wealthy people in the country.  But we were not in the predicament we are in now that the so-called free market people have been in charge for several decades.</p>
<p>My point is NOT to equalize everyone.  But it is to reduce the incentives of the most financially successful to create dynasties of privilege over everyone else by reducing both their means to game the system and their payoffs for doing so.  Maybe a very steep income tax at the highest income levels is not the way to go.  There might be better ways.  But if we want to remain a free society we need to defend ourselves against the ruthless oligarchs who have come ever more brazenly to dominate our country.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most important developments in the modern world is the rise of democracies to becoming the dominant part of the world’s population, and economic and military power.  The chief reason this unprecedented development is important is that only liberal democracies never fight wars with one another.  The  recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/world/americas/09colombia.html?th&#038;emc=th">peaceful settlement</a> of the crisis on the borders of Ecuador, Columbia, and Venezuela is a powerful illustration of this fact.</p>
<p>The pioneering work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Rummel">Rudy Rummel</a> powerfully <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/">demonstrates</a>  that the democratic peace is significant statistically, and both he and I (scroll to <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?page_id=16">here</a>  and down to democratic peace article)  have explained the reasons for this continued peace: that democracies are emergent orders and not hierarchical organizations, as are undemocratic states.  Different dynamics apply to their behavior as systems, dynamics that tend to keep the peace when both parties are democratic.</p>
<p>For the first time in human history a solution to war might have evolved, and done so unintentionally.  It does not guarantee peace.  There are too many sociopaths in power and serving the role of neoconservative advisors to ever be 100% certain.  But it is very unlikely.</p>
<p>The largest threat to that solution – the threat of the US Presidency evolving into a Caesarist dictator elected every four years - now seems destined to failure.  A powerful executive independent of domestic democratic pressures is no more likely to keep the peace than any other kind of dictator or king, as Kaiser Wilhelm demonstrated so tragically in WWI.  He is too insulated from what it is that promotes peace which are the dynamics of a democratic system far more than the character of the individuals who hold power.<br />
This is the one area where Prof. Rummel and I parted ways.  He supported our imperial venture against Iraq because he believed the Bush administration intended to build a democracy there and that once Hussein was gone it would be possible to construct one.  I opposed it because I believe democracies have to build on internally generated institutions currently lacking in Iraq and because the centralizing of American political power would weaken the reasons for the democratic peace by moving us towards a government like Wilhelmine Germany: a dictator abroad with democracy locally.</p>
<p>I believe events have demonstrated who was correct here.  There are things we and other democracies can do to promote more democracies, but imposing them violently on cultures with no previous experience of basic free institutions is not one of them.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is Barack Obama’s speech against going to war in Iraq.  He spoke when others such as myself also opposed the war and took constant flak from right wingers and their Democratic enablers.</p>
<p>At the same time some, like Hillary Clinton, actively facilitated it and hundreds of thousands of deaths later, still refuse to admit an error.  She even has the temerity to attack Obama on issues of judgment and experience.  I urge anyone reading my blog to read Obama’s speech here and ask yourself who has the best demonstrated judgment. It is not long.</p>
<p>With thanks to Americacblog for originally <a href="http://www.americablog.com/2008/03/2002-speech-that-hillary-is-afraid-of.html">posting</a> it.</p>
<p>I will still vote for her if she is the candidate.  But I will feel queasy doing so.<br />
<br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">October 2, 2002</span></p>
<p>Good afternoon. Let me begin by saying that although this has been billed as an anti-war rally, I stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances. The Civil War was one of the bloodiest in history, and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword, the sacrifice of multitudes, that we could begin to perfect this union, and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil. I don&#8217;t oppose all wars.<br />
<a id="more-112"></a><br />
My grandfather signed up for a war the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, fought in Patton&#8217;s army. He saw the dead and dying across the fields of Europe; he heard the stories of fellow troops who first entered Auschwitz and Treblinka. He fought in the name of a larger freedom, part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil, and he did not fight in vain. I don&#8217;t oppose all wars.</p>
<p>After September 11th, after witnessing the carnage and destruction, the dust and the tears, I supported this administration&#8217;s pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance, and I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again. I don&#8217;t oppose all wars. And I know that in this crowd today, there is no shortage of patriots, or of patriotism.</p>
<p>What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair, weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne.</p>
<p>What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the median income - to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the Great Depression. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m opposed to. A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics. Now let me be clear - I suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal man. A ruthless man. A man who butchers his own people to secure his own power. He has repeatedly defied UN resolutions, thwarted UN inspection teams, developed chemical and biological weapons, and coveted nuclear capacity. He&#8217;s a bad guy. The world, and the Iraqi people, would be better off without him.</p>
<p>But I also know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States, or to his neighbors, that the Iraqi economy is in shambles, that the Iraqi military a fraction of its former strength, and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until, in the way of all petty dictators, he falls away into the dustbin of history. I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a US occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences. I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East, and encourage the worst, rather than best, impulses of the Arab world, and strengthen the recruitment arm of Al Qaeda. I am not opposed to all wars. I&#8217;m opposed to dumb wars.</p>
<p>So for those of us who seek a more just and secure world for our children, let us send a clear message to the President today. You want a fight, President Bush? Let&#8217;s finish the fight with Bin Laden and Al Qaeda, through effective, coordinated intelligence, and a shutting down of the financial networks that support terrorism, and a homeland security program that involves more than color-coded warnings. You want a fight, President Bush?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s fight to make sure that the UN inspectors can do their work, and that we vigorously enforce a non-proliferation treaty, and that former enemies and current allies like Russia safeguard and ultimately eliminate their stores of nuclear material, and that nations like Pakistan and India never use the terrible weapons already in their possession, and that the arms merchants in our own country stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe. You want a fight, President Bush?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s fight to make sure our so-called allies in the Middle East, the Saudis and the Egyptians, stop oppressing their own people, and suppressing dissent, and tolerating corruption and inequality, and mismanaging their economies so that their youth grow up without education, without prospects, without hope, the ready recruits of terrorist cells. You want a fight, President Bush? Let&#8217;s fight to wean ourselves off Middle East oil, through an energy policy that doesn&#8217;t simply serve the interests of Exxon and Mobil. Those are the battles that we need to fight. Those are the battles that we willingly join. The battles against ignorance and intolerance. Corruption and greed. Poverty and despair.</p>
<p>The consequences of war are dire, the sacrifices immeasurable. We may have occasion in our lifetime to once again rise up in defense of our freedom, and pay the wages of war. But we ought not &#8212; we will not &#8212; travel down that hellish path blindly. Nor should we allow those who would march off and pay the ultimate sacrifice, who would prove the full measure of devotion with their blood, to make such an awful sacrifice in vain.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend asked me who I supported for President.  She knew it would be either Clinton or Obama.  As things now stand I would vote for a box turtle for President over any likely Republican candidate.  But why Obama and not Clinton?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>1. Hillary is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/10/17/defense-industry-embraces_n_68927.html">too close </a>to the defense industry - like very very close.</p>
<p>2. She has consistently supported Bush on key votes making it easier to attack others - most recently Iran.  I opposed the Iraq war well before it broke out and made predictions that have been just about 100% true. If I could do it, she has no excuse.  Obama also opposed it - and Clinton has tried to muddy that distinction.  It is a very important distinction - <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/10/11/iraq.deaths/">over 500,000</a> Iraqis are dead today who would not be had Bush not attacked.  Clinton shares in the guilt.  Obama does not.  Clinton has yet to fess up and admit she was wrong.  We&#8217;ve had enough Presidents who cannot admit they were wrong.</p>
<p>3. I think dynastic politics are bad for democracies, particularly democracies in trouble, like ours.  An office holder ideally should not be thinking about impact on family members&#8217; careers when making policy.  In fact, I think there should be a constitutional amendment barring direct spouses and descendants of federal office holders from holding the same office.</p>
<p>4. She makes a big point of her experience, but it is the people with experience that have gotten us into this horrible mess because most of them take as their frame of reference their friends in Washington, and not the well being of the country as a whole.  Bush did not have experience, but the rest of his crowd had plenty, and Democrats with experience did a lousy job of fighting against them.  Further, Clinton has refused to allow the public access to records of her experience (see below).</p>
<p>5. So far as I can tell - and this is speculative - Hillary is less likely than Obama to support <a href="http://www.talkleft.com/story/2007/2/18/15322/3156">cutting back the abuses</a> of Executive power that Bush got away with - and that is very important for the long run.  To be fair Clinto does say she would<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/10/11/clinton_vows_to_check_executive_power/"> cut back </a>the abuses.  I&#8217;ve had it with <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/57351">secrecy freaks</a>.  See also <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2007/11/archives2.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>6. Obama may do a great deal symbolically to encourage Black Americans to enter the main stream more whole heartedly than they have - especially young ones.  Now the same logic could be legitimately used for supporting a woman President - but women are rapidly entering the mainstreeam at ever higher levels.  It&#8217;s a matter of time before one becomes President.  I think the symbolic impact of Hillary Clinton getting it will be less than Obama getting it - and after the past 7 years I think we strongly need a symbolic btreak with the past and everything that is connected with the Republican Party in its present form.</p>
<p>7. Obama appeals to the non establishment wing of the Democratic Party and to the youth vote. The establishment wing has done a very poor job fighting the radical right and young people are a long term investment.</p>
<p>My bad boy side adds . . . And electing Obama will stick it to the South&#8230;</p>
<p>But if Hillary wins it, I will strongly support and happily vote for her.  Politics is rarely getting one&#8217;s first choice and compared to the likely Republican opposition, well, she is beyond comparison.</p>
<p>I wish both had shown more leadership on FISA, war spending, and other issues while in the Senate.  I&#8217;m not a super partisan of Obama, but I think on balance he&#8217;s a significantly better choice.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post fulfills a promise I made in the Solstice post below.</p>
<p>The extraordinary and disturbing entry of religion into American politics over the past few decades raises an important question for all people with a spiritual commitment: how should  their spiritual practice most effectively and appropriately influence their lives as citizens.  As citizens we are called upon to address the major issues of our time.  As religious people our beliefs are foundational to many of our most fundamental ethical positions.  But how do they go together?  If we are historically informed, or are even minimally attentive today, we know religious beliefs can inject a spirit impervious to rational discussion and destructive to the requirements for a democratic society.</p>
<p>And so we wonder what we should do.<br />
<a id="more-101"></a><br />
At least when integrated into politics, religions in the past have been as often involved in horrible crimes against others as they have been sources of peace and compassion, maybe more so.  Mixing religion into hotly contested political issues means combining two human activities likely to cause their adherents to confuse feelings of powerful self-righteousness with possessing truth or virtue.  When that happens it becomes difficult to see those who disagree as well-meaning.  Those who are not with us are against us.  And those who are against us are not simply our opponents; they are our enemies.</p>
<p>But many of us, and I among them, find our deepest ethical commitments rooted in our spirituality, and motivating our political action.  Were it not so we would likely be neither as focused or committed as we are.</p>
<p>How do we find balance here?  Especially for we who emphasize the sacredness and goodness of this world rather than focusing on the rewards of the next</p>
<p>I will start with a basic truth.  Religion deals with our relationship to the More Than Human in community with others.  By ‘human’ I include ourselves in our mundane awareness of and focus on our personal hopes, wishes, fears, and desires.  I do not use “mundane” negatively. Those spiritual traditions that seek to remove a person from concern with mundane things resort to monasticism.  If everyone became a monk or nun the human adventure would end in a generation.</p>
<p>So, whatever the virtues of monasticism, and there are virtues, they are not easily assimilated into a spiritual perspective emphasizing embodied life as more blessing than problem.  When monks can change diapers and raise toddlers and teenagers on a large scale, I will reconsider this conclusion.</p>
<p>But along with and connected to its blessings, the mundane brings a problem spirituality addresses.  As unavoidably partial beings who deeply need others, food, clothing, and the like, we are prone towards seeing all issues in terms of how they relate to our needy self, a self that necessarily manifests with embodiment. We are prone towards weighing the needs we feel more heavily than needs we do not feel, even though others might feel them.  We therefore tend to privilege even relatively trivial personal needs over other larger needs reportedly felt by strangers.</p>
<p>To a point this is not a problem.  We are also limited in our knowledge, and I am more likely to know how to address my own felt needs than I am the probable needs of strangers.  In a reasonably good society most of the time  most people and their immediate friends and associates will be able to manage their personal needs without needing to rely on strangers.  So to a point this mundane attitude is in keeping with the kind of world in which we live.</p>
<p>But our society is often not reasonably good, and we often go past this point.  Too often.</p>
<p>Religions at their best expand the self through growing compassion and love.  Our circle of care grows to encompass others, potentially indefinitely.  This is in perfect harmony with a Pagan position emphasizing the world as sacred and its existence a blessing.</p>
<p>What expands the self to encompass others caringly is in harmony with religion.  What does not may not be.  What shrinks the self, and so reduces our circle of care, is always in disharmony with genuine spirituality, although it frequently masquerades as such.<br />
<br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">On Self-Righteousness</span><br />
Self-righteousness is the most malignant shrinking of the self because it justifies itself by referring to allegedly universal moral principles.  The needy ego justifies its own self-righteousness by hiding behind grand abstractions such as Humanity, God, the Goddess, the Earth, Justice, Peace, Love, and so on.  A small ego takes considerable pleasure in speaking and acting in the name of something large and grand.  I’ve done it and probably you’ve also done it.  Afterwards we usually wish we had acted more wisely and compassionately, and much less judgmentally.</p>
<p>The spirit of self-righteousness loves dualisms and dichotomies.  They give it energy, the energy of passionate outrage.  This energy often feels good to us because it gives us a sense we are connected to and empowered by something bigger than we are, something good by definition. It may also release dopamine and other chemicals enabling the self-righteous to feel good, a kind of self-induced <a href="http://www.davidbrin.com/addiction.html">addiction</a>.</p>
<p>If so, self-righteousness is spiritual meth.</p>
<p>What makes the targets of our outrage so loathsome is not so much what they did as what they symbolize.  They too become markers for something bigger than they are, but they come to symbolize evil, corruption, degeneracy, Satan, and similar abstractions.  Thus when immersed in self-righteousness we become dedicated fighters in Good vs. Evil.</p>
<p>It’s a big ego trip while it lasts.</p>
<p>Self-righteousness is the enemy of genuine spirituality and of religion as a means by which a community celebrates and expresses this spirituality.  Genuine spirituality is rooted in concrete experience.  Love and compassion, kindness and generosity, only have meaning when applied to concrete cases.  The abstraction “God loves us” has probably never changed anyone’s life.  A genuine encounter with Divine Love has changed many lives, including my own.</p>
<p>Self-righteousness is to spirituality as sodium is to water.  It is to religion as termites are to wood.<br />
<br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">Religion and Politics</span><br />
Bringing religion into politics runs the real risk of our ending up hiding behind abstractions, demonizing those who see the world differently, and ultimately subverting the goodness of our own spiritual tradition.  But this danger does not mean we should rigorously exclude religion from politics.  We cannot.</p>
<p>What we can do is apply to the best of our ability the qualities of love, kindness, compassion, patience, and generosity our religion helps us develop to our political action.  This seems to be one clear way of distinguishing the differences between, say, how Martin Luther King and Jerry Falwell apply their Christianity to politics.  We can learn from them.</p>
<p>King said certain values (respect for people regardless of race) are worth following and while he spoke in their defense from within his own tradition, every decent tradition values them.  In these very concrete instances of segregation and denial of voting rights they are being violated, and these violations should stop.  King could defend these values by referring not only to his own tradition, but to the highest values of humanity in general.  One did not have to agree with his theology to agree with his proposals.</p>
<p>Falwell said certain people are enemies of God/Morality/etc., and they must be fought.  What is &#8216;moral&#8217; in this case (subordination of women, anti-abortion, anti-gay) is moral because of <em>his </em>reading of scripture.  No other arguments were offered and other traditions were attacked. All who disagree with him are enemies of God and lack the faith needed to see the error of their ways.</p>
<p>King strengthened democracy and Falwell subverted it.  Those of us who find our own strongest convictions in our spiritual life are committed as citizens of a democracy to offer reasons others who have not had our religious experiences can find convincing.  A free nation depends on its citizens in the last analysis privileging reason and persuasion over power and authority, on all sides.  Given that people will always disagree it is the offering of reasons on both sides that provides grounds for coming together or agreeing to disagree.  Abandon the requirement to justify a position by giving reasons and the grounds for toleration are undermined.</p>
<p>To take a personal example, my environmental work is rooted in my love of the earth and its life forms, and my personal experience that both the Earth (or at least major land forms)  and many elements within it that our society deems inert are in fact sentient and aware, from mountains and oceans to trees and flowers.  But I cannot reliably guarantee similar experiences to people who have not had encounters like mine.  So I seek to discover arguments enabling us to agree on concrete outcomes even if their motivations will be as limited by their own experiences and individuality as mine are by mine.  And of course doing so requires me to try and find commonalities between myself and others, bridges over which we can come to agreements.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Of Ritual and Politics</span><br />
My earlier post had taken the strongest possible exception to injecting politics into a Solstice ritual.  One reader defended this mixing by saying that minus the politics ritual was just escapism.  I disagree.  Good ritual reconnects us with the larger context within which we live our lives, including our political lives.  It rejuvenates and re-empowers us regarding what our lives are about, including our political actions.  By putting politics within a timeless and larger context it gives us the distance we need to think more clearly about the issues involved.</p>
<p>Let me give a simple and in some ways trivial example.  When we play a board game we can become totally engrossed in the game.  Winning becomes a Big Goal.  Should a player suddenly decide that the game is a waist of time and begin playing erratically, we can get angry at him or her.  Even though it is “only a game.”</p>
<p>What is true of games is even more true for the more serious activities of our lives, including for many of us, politics.  We get so drawn in that we lose sight of the larger context.  And, to mix metaphors, we come to want the ring of power for its own sake because all other contexts have disappeared.</p>
<p>Games end and we can then take stock of who we are and who our game opponents are.  We get perspective.  The passions of the game take in a very different intensity.  But when embodied life ends we enter the great mystery of the afterlife.  During life we do not have so easy an opportunity to stand back and put the “game of life” into a larger context.</p>
<p>Religion and religious ritual help us grasp this larger context.  We can enter more explicitly into a sacred space.   But to do so the ritual must transcend politics, focusing on the eternal, the universal, on that which puts the mundane into an appropriate perspective.  It must takes us as far from immersion in the political world as after the game life removes us from the world of gaming.</p>
<p>The consciousness shift that occurs in good ritual us essential to this.  Starting with the grounding, we disengage ourselves from the cares of the day and the worries of our lives, to go .. .elsewhere for a time.  In the case of the Solstice ritual that ultimately provoked this piece, I who am about as political as anyone I know (just read this blog…) had been really looking forward to a ritual for just that reason.  And I was particularly disappointed when the opposite happened.  Happily I got my needed distancing the next night, at a smaller Sabbat celebration on the real Solstice.</p>
<p>Had the ritual been billed as one for empowering community political work and the like, I would not have objected, but I probably would not have come.  Had I come, even if I thought it could have been done differently or better, I would not have posted anything.  It was because it was billed as a Solstice celebration that I came and because it was not in the sense I am describing that I was disappointed.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Witches Against Hitler and What It Means for Us</span><br />
When Hitler planned to invade Great Britain many English Witches did rituals to prevent a Nazi invasion.  Whether they worked or not will never be known.  What we do know is that what was done was in harmony with a Wiccan view of the world that often works in a smaller scale, that the invasion never happened, and that the change in Hitler’s plans was unexpected by all involved on both sides.  Successful or not, this was religious involvement in politics on a grand scale indeed.</p>
<p>It is also in harmony with the principles I have just elucidated.</p>
<p>Energy was raised, given great additional strength by the voluntary sacrifice of some participants’ lives, and a powerful “NO.  YOU WILL NOT COME” was sent to Hitler.  Philip Heselton’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wiccan-Roots-Gardner-Witchcraft-Revival/dp/1861631103/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1199743673&#038;sr=1-2">book</a> gives many of the details.</p>
<p>Note first that the working was very concrete and specific.  It was a binding – and a very powerful one.  Nothing was at all abstract about it.  Second, there was universal agreement about the concrete specifics of what was desired by all involved.  A powerful unity of will was achieved because of the very simplicity of the issue: stop an invasion.  Third, it could be done, indeed it had to be done, from within a ritually specific consciousness far removed from the normal, and certainly removed from analytic thought.</p>
<p>This it seems to me is a good example of specifically Pagan political involvement. We can learn from it. (In fact I have learned of somewhat similar rituals more recently that also appear to have worked.)  It is done entirely outside the political arena.  It does not deal with making laws, convincing potential allies, or anything at all mundane.  The moral issues are extraordinarily clear for those involved.  It is oriented towards defense against aggression, not control of others in matters other than simply stopping them from doing harm.</p>
<p>Thus it had all the elements of a good magickal working.</p>
<p>Had the working’s goal been abstract, such as “Hitler will learn love”  the unity of wills required would have been harder to achieve because “love” means different things to different people, even if all agree on the goal in the abstract.    Had it been for “World Peace” the problems would have been harder still.  What does that really mean concretely?  What would it look like?  There would be a number of interpretations.  And the number of people required to be influenced by it would have been hopelessly disproportionate to the powers of those doing the working.</p>
<p>There is another dimension to consider here.  I was asked some years ago to participate in a working against George Bush.  I declined, but not because I thought such a working was in principle unwise.  At the time literally everything that happened was working in the man’s favor.  All ‘coincidences’ helped him.  It seemed to me that larger patterns were at work, patterns so strong that facing them head-on was unwise.</p>
<p>I counseled waiting.</p>
<p>Of course it seemed in the Britain of the early ‘40s that everything was also working in Hitler’s favor when the Witch-working against him occurred.  But the difference was that the realm of relevant possible  choices had become very small and very focused.  Either he would invade, or he would not.  And the message was not to undo Hitler or overthrow him, but to prevent a specific possible outcome, an outcome where the will of only one man was decisive.</p>
<p>Had the plan I was invited to participate in been similarly specific – say, to save the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge – I would  have participated.  And I suspect such working were in fact done….  ANWR is still not been drilled, against all odds.  My point is not that effective ritual is invincible – only that it shifts the energetic probabilities, and in the absence of effective opposition can make a significant difference for the better.</p>
<p>So my message here is not to divorce spirituality and religion from politics, but to be very wise in how we mix them.<br />

<p style="text-align: left">The photograph on the right is of a Moslem suicide bomber, holding a Koran.  But the photograph on the left is of US soldiers holding a Bible.  The similarity is not accidental.  All see themselves as warriors for God.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">Jason Leopold of the Baltimore Chronicle has written a <a href="http://baltimorechronicle.com/2007/122207Leopold.shtml">chilling story</a>, chilling at least for anyone who values the well-being of our country. Leopold describes the environment new recruits face when entering basic training at Fort Jackson in South Carolina.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">Frank Bussey, director of Military Ministry at Fort Jackson, has been telling soldiers at Fort Jackson that &#8220;government authorities, police and the military = God&#8217;s Ministers.&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
<p style="margin-left: 40px">Bussey&#8217;s teachings from the &#8220;God&#8217;s Basic Training&#8221; Bible study guide he authored says US troops have &#8220;two primary responsibilities&#8221;: &#8220;to praise those who do right&#8221; and &#8220;to punish those who do evil - Gods&#8217;s servant, an angel of wrath.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Left unmentioned is defending the Constitution of the United States, to which they pledged an oath of allegiance, or even defending the country as a whole&#8230;  Instead, Leopold reports,<a id="more-99"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px">soldiers on the battlefield have told disturbing stories of being force-fed fundamentalist Christianity by highly controversial, apocalyptic &#8220;End Times&#8221; evangelists, who have infiltrated US military installations throughout the world with the blessing of high-level officials at the Pentagon. Proselytizing among military personnel has been conducted openly, in violation of the basic tenets of the United States Constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">Instead, as Leopold shows, there is widespread violation of US law regarding separation of church and state, often with the connivance of ranking base military officers at Fort Jackson and elsewhere.  The purge of army officers by the Bush administration takes on a new dimension when we witness the lawlessness of the military opportunists who have risen after their departure.  American taxpayers are paying for a future US &#8216;Christian&#8217; Taliban.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="margin-left: 40px">The executive director of Military Ministry, retired US Army Major General Bob Dees, wrote in the organization&#8217;s October 2005 &#8220;Life and Leadership&#8221; newsletter, &#8220;We must pursue our particular means for transforming the nation - through the military. And the military may well be the most influential way to affect that spiritual superstructure. Militaries exercise, generally speaking, the most intensive and purposeful indoctrination program of citizens&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">Moreover, Military Ministry&#8217;s parent organization, Campus Crusade for Christ, has been re-distributing to military chaplains a DVD produced a decade ago where Tommy Nelson, a pastor at the Denton Bible Church in Denton, Texas, tells an audience of Texas A&#038;M cadets and military officers when they join the military &#8220;then you are also in the ministry.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">The <a href="http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/">Military Religious Freedom Foundation</a> has issued a <a href="http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/press-releases/dec07report.html">report</a> on radical Christianist subversion of our military.  It should be a must-pread for all Americans, who should then aske themselves how much they want religious war both abroad and at home.  Because if history is any guide, and on these matters it is, religious war is what these forces are seeking.  In part, the report describes</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px">Mandatory Christian concerts at basic training installations &#8212; <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/update/2007/11/eric-horner-american-soldiers.html">This story</a> was written about by Josh Harkinson on Mother Jones a few weeks ago, but the track-covering done by Eric Horner Ministries after the Mother Jones story is a story in itself. Eric Horner, a Christian country singer, regularly appears at military bases, with some performances being mandatory for basic trainees. He has endorsements from General Petraeus and other commanders, was introduced to George Bush by Fort Jackson&#8217;s base commander, Brig. Gen. James H. Schwitters, and, most recently, has been made an &#8220;honorary Ft. Jackson drill sergeant&#8221; by Gen. Schwitters.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">The problem is not entertainment.  The problem is the goals of those providing the entertainment.  The more I looked into the story the more frightening it became.  For example, Mother Jones <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/update/2007/11/anti-crusader-mikey-weinstein.html">reports</a> that</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px">This summer [Mikey Weinstein] uncovered plans by the Pentagon to ship &#8220;freedom packages&#8221; to soldiers in Iraq that were to contain Bibles, proselytizing material in English and Arabic, and <em>Left Behind: Eternal Forces</em>, a video game inspired by post-Rapture novels in which &#8220;soldiers for Christ&#8221; hunt enemies who look suspiciously like U.N. peacekeepers. Partly due to Weinstein&#8217;s efforts, the packages were never sent.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">This example is not isolated, the MRFF Report also included a photo of an office door in a Military Police battalion&#8217;s office at Ft. Riley, Kansas, depicting a picture of Ann Coulter and her quote, &#8220;We should invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity.&#8221;  I was unable to find the photos on the web, but see the AP report <a href="http://real-us.news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071219/ap_on_re_us/military_religion_lawsuit">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">Chris Hedges <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20061231_chris_hedges_americas_holy_warriors/">reports</a>, about 50% of military chaplains are currently affiliated with the Christian right. To put this in perspective, what would people think if almost 50% of educators were members of the Communist Party?  My comparison is not unreasonable, for chaplains are uniquely trusted people for many young and poorly educated men and women seeking to serve their country and improve their lives by enlisting.  You might say &#8220;But radical fundamentalists are a p[art of our country.&#8221;  Yes they are.  But they are not anywhere close to 50%. And they explicitly reject the values this nations was founded on.  By genuinely American standards, they are Americans, but they are bad ones.   Like Communists.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Training soldiers to give their primary allegiance to a specific deity, particularly one as violent and murderous as the fundamentalist Christian one,  is an act of open rebellion against the Constitution and against the American people as a whole.  The military officers involved need to be court martialed and expelled from the armed forces whose oath of allegiance they have sullied.  Campus Crusade for Christ and other subversive organizations should be publicly denounced as the enemies of our country.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">The issue becomes even more grave when we observe <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=8992128">the rise</a> of the right wing&#8217;s private army, Blackwater.  Blackwater&#8217;s <a href="http://afterenlightenment.blogspot.com/2007/11/blackwater-christian-supremacy-and_04.html">leadership</a>, a single multimillionaire, is also an important part of the Christianist radical right.  Anyone paying attention to the news knows that Blackwater&#8217;s people have been involved in war crimes, but have been immune to prosecution by both Iraqi and American courts.  The Bush administration has actively covered their misdeeds, even when these crimes inflame Iraqi opinion against the US, resulting in additional deaths of legitimate American soldiers.   They receive no-bid contracts awarding them enormous amounts of money while undermining our country&#8217;s civil institutions.   For example Blackwater&#8217;s government contracts for guarding New Orleans after Katrina from September 8 to September 30, 2005, totalled $409,000 for providing fourteen guards and four vehicles to &#8220;protect the temporary morgue in Baton Rouge, LA.&#8221;  If anything it is worse in Iraq.  <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/interview/item/20070330_jeremy_scahill_on_soldiers_of_fortune/">According to Jeremy Scahill</a> Blackwater&#8217;s mercenaries are paid six to seven times what regular U.S. soldiers make and are given better equipment and body armor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">Blackwater represents the rise of a private army, an army paid much better by tax funds from political allies than are legitimate US soldiers.  You can get access to substantial information on Blackwater <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Blackwater_USA#Books">here</a>.  If we look at past history, the Roman Republic was destroyed through the rise of private armies loyal to particular men rather than the republic.  Blackwater represents such a force, paid by American citizens while simultaneously our own army is undermined and subverted from within.  Wporse yet, it is potentially an ideological force, swerving radical Christianists bent on destroying the United States as we have known it, replacing it with a theocratic horror second to none.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">This danger these developments pose is not lost on some legitimately Christian observers, such as <a href="http://www.etherzone.com/2007/cron010807.shtml">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">A little more historical perspective is useful here.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The United States is unique among major Western nations in not having had a history of religious war.  In England and the European continent were not so fortunate.  Millions died as Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists sought to exterminate one another in the name of their God.  In many ways the most violent war in European history was a religious one.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years'_War">Thirty Years War</a> annihilated one third of the population of what is now Germany and the Czech Republic.  Poland entered the war a Protestant country, and left it a Catholic one.  The means employed were not peaceful conversion.   Ending in 1648, with the English Civil War finally coming to an end three years later, this violent and relatively recent history was powerfully in our Founding Fathers&#8217; minds.  They did all they could to prevent its equivalent happening here.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">Today the subversives in the radical right are undermining their work, undermining America from within, all the while wrapped in the flag they claim to love while ignoring every value it symbolizes.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The obvious failings of our court system have encouraged some free market theorists to support binding arbitration a more efficient alternative. In doing so many of the greates failings of classical liberal thought come to a head: its lack of awareness that public values exist, its lack of a real theory of power, its equating justice with efficiency, and its subordination of genuine human beings to theoretical abstractions on which they are impaled.</p>
<p>Jamie Leigh Jones&#8217; <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/12/19/162652/29/685/424439">unbelieveable ordeal</a> along with the depravity it exposes at all levels of our government and its corporate cronies, should give many classical liberals long pause.  For some of her video testimony, see <a href="http://www.tortdeform.com/archives/2007/12/update_on_halliburton_camp_hop_1.html">here</a>. In case anyone does not yet know, she was drugged and gang raped in Baghdad by American employees of Halliburton&#8217;s subsidiary, KBR.   The company locked her into a cubicle, without food or water, after she reported it.  She was finally freed after a sympathetic guard loaned her a cell p[hone with which she called her father in Texas, who alerted the State Department, which then freed her. She needed an operation to help repair the physical injuries she suffered in the assault, but KBR then &#8216;lost&#8217; the medical evidence of her rape, making conviction impossible.  The State Department did nothing other than freeing her.</p>
<p>KBR argues she has no legal standing because she signed a binding arbitration agreement when she accepted employment.</p>
<p>Jones testified to Congress:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px">“There has been no prosecution after two and a half years.  The arbitration laws are so abusive that Halliburton is trying to force this into a secret proceeding, which will do nothing to prevent continued abuse of this nature. What is there to stop these companies from victimizing women in the future? The United States has to provide people with their day in court when they have been raped and assaulted by other American citizens. Otherwise, we are not only deprived of our justice in the criminal courts, but the civil courts as well. The laws have left us nowhere to turn.”</div>
<p>When people work for “private contractors” they apparently give up all their legal rights.  Raped, beaten, severely injured, imprisoned – and because she signed a binding arbitration agreement with corporate goons, she likely has no recourse with a government that never met a corporation it didn’t want to help, or a citizen it didn’t want to screw.  When she went to a company supplied psychiatrist, the first question she was asked was whether she planned to sue.</p>
<p>Evidence of the absolute moral depravity of the American right wing in all its guises?  Yes.  But she also would have no recourse in many versions of a pure “libertarian” or classical liberal society, either.</p>
<p>Jones&#8217; ordeal exposes the theoretical emptiness of most contemporary free market thought. It needs a theory of power able to confront concrete realities and not just the abstract equality of contracts considered without attention to context. The concept of arbitration among genuine equals has great merit.  When applied to formal equals who in reality are anything but equal. It leads to atrocities such as what happened to Jamie Leigh Jones.

<p>For me, one of the most depressing aspects of the past seven years is that it seems so many Americans forgot what they learned in the 60s, and many of those born since did not learn from our experience.  In all too many cases my generation failed miserably in educating our young.  Now they are having to learn the same lesson.  Hopefully they will do a better job of passing on their hard won wisdom.<br />
Some are doing so.</p>
<p>After Natalie Maines observed the Chicks were ashamed George Bush was from Texas, the following trashing of the Dixie Chicks and their music by imbeciles, monsters, Clear Channel&#8217;s corporate goons and the sheep they deceived and led,  proved an early indicator of the totalitarian ethos underlying the evil that masquerades as &#8220;conservatism&#8221; today.  Today any sentient American is ashamed George Bush is from Texas and lives in the US.  But then it took both insight and courage to criticize the criminal sitting in the White House.  I will always remember, for members of my own family accused me of &#8220;treason&#8221; for criticizing him.</p>
<p>So it was with real pleasure when I read  <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/12/19/11512/286/827/424289">today</a> in Daily Kos that one of the Chicks&#8217; most visible critics during that dark <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> event, a young mother shown in the media teaching her toddler son to say &#8220;screw the chicks&#8221; while she helped destroy their CDs, has since grown into an impressive human being, and come to a  very different perspective. And Andrea S. has since shown genuine courage acting on her hard won wisdom.   Perhaps others are learning as well.  Read her story <a href="http://dixiechicks.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5817958">here</a>.</p>
<p>She has more balls and courage than any of the &#8220;conservatives&#8221; still defending the war, Bush, and torture.  By far.
