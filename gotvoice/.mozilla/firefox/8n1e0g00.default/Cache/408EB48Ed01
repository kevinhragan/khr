<h3>Independent Spending Gurus Key to Battle for House</h3>


<a id="a058710"></a>

<p>The battle for House control is already well underway with a <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/04/more_special_election_trouble.html">key special election</a> later this month in Mississippi's 1st District and another in early May in Louisiana's 6th District.</p>

<p>To that end, both the <a href="http://www.dccc.org">Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee</a> and the <a href="http://www.nrcc.org">National Republican Congressional Committee</a> have recently established their independent expenditure operations and staffed them up.</p>

<p>The vast majority of spending by these committees now comes in the form of independent expenditures (IEs), which can be made in unlimited amounts on behalf of campaigns with the lone caveat being that the IE staff cannot have any contact with candidates or their campaigns. Independent expenditures typically take the form of television ads but can also encompass polling, direct mail, phone banks and other persuasion tools.</p>

<p>Over the last few election cycles, IE operations have become all the rage at the party committees, with tens of millions of dollars spent through them. Given the amounts of money at stake, the staff entrusted with spending it on behalf of the party are among the most influential figures in determining the House and Senate playing field.</p>

<p>For Democrats, <strong>Jon Vogel</strong> will leave his position as political director at the DCCC to head up the IE operation. Vogel is in his second cycle with the DCCC, having served as the northeast region political director in 2006.</p>

<p>His deputy will be <strong>Katharine Lister</strong>, who joins the IE operation straight from a stint at <strong>Fund for America</strong> -- one of the primary progressive soft-money vehicles operating currently.</p>

<p>Their counterparts at the NRCC IE will be <strong>Clinton Key</strong>, a longtime party strategist, and <strong>Evan Kozlow</strong>.</p>

<p>Key, like NRCC Chairman Tom Cole, has long ties to Oklahoma. Elected as state party chairman in Oklahoma in 1989, Key went on to serve as a chief of staff to Gov. Frank Keating (R) during the 1990s.  Key came to Washington in the late 1990s to serve as executive director of the Republican Governors Association.</p>

<p>Kozlow came up in the bare-knuckled world of New Jersey politics, managing Rep. Scott Garrett's (R) 2002 victory in the 5th District and then serving as campaign manager for the unsuccessful U.S. Senate bid of state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. (R) in 2006. Kozlow joined the NRCC last year as director of Member Services.</p>

<p>The NRCC and DCCC are already on television in Louisiana's 6th, where state Rep. <a href="http://www.doncazayoux.org/"><strong>Don Cazayoux</strong></a> (D) and former state Rep. <a href="http://www.woodyjenkinsforcongress.com/"><strong>Woody Jenkins</strong></a> (R) will face off on May 3 to replace Rep. Richard Baker (R).</p>

<p>The NRCC, struggling to keep up financially with its Democratic counterpart, is also on television in Mississippi's 1st with ads hitting Prentiss County Chancery Clerk <a href="http://www.childersforcongress.com/"><strong>Travis Childers</strong></a> for his record as a nursing home owner. </p>

<p><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/p4rfpC4_aa8&hl=en"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/p4rfpC4_aa8&hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>

<p>The NRCC has spent over $230,000 to date on its independent expenditure efforts in Mississippi and more than $100,000 on Louisiana's 6th. The DCCC has dropped nearly $300,000 in Louisiana but is not yet on the air (or in mailboxes) in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Given the potential size of the national playing field (Democrats insist 75 or more seats could be competitive this year), the respective IE operations for the two committees will be tested like never before. How they perform could determine just how large Democrats' gains will be in the fall.</p>

<h3>Spinning the Debate's Aftermath</h3>



<span style="font-family:Times New Roman,times,serif; font-size:12px;">

<p> <strong>PHILADELPHIA</strong> -- The Fix is headed out on the campaign trail today to catch Sen. <strong><a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/hillary-clinton/">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a></strong> (N.Y.) at a few events (and to sample some of the reader recommendations for the best cheesesteak out there).</p>

<p>But, before we go, we would be remiss not to offer a quick update on the spin coming out of last night's Democratic presidential debate.</p>

<p>As you might expect, Clinton campaign aides in the spin room last night were quite pleased with the debate and then sought to capitalize on what they believe to be an opening during a conference call this morning.</p>

<p>"The debate last night was really about leadership," said Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson on the call. "Senator Clinton showed the strength of her leadership...Senator Obama, on the other hand, did not have a very good night."</p>

<p>Wolfson insisted that <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> failed to fully answer questions about a 1996 questionnaire in which he appeared to back a total ban on guns and <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/02/obamas_weatherman_connection.html">his connection to a former member of the radical anti-war Weather Underground.</a></p>

<p>"When Senator Obama had a chance to give clear, concise accurate answers...he failed to do," Wolfson said.  </p>

<p>Asked about whether the debate sponsored by ABC News was slanted against Obama or dipped too much into trivia, Wolfson said that "in an ideal world I wish we could conduct our campaigns on questions of policy and policy differentiation" but added: "We have all learned that campaigns are about more than that and the kinds of questions Senator Obama was asked last night are the kind of questions that if he is our nominee he is likely to face on an ongoing basis in the fall."</p>

<p>For its part, the Obama campaign touted two pieces of good news in the wake of the debate: the endorsement of the <a href="http://www.philly.com/dailynews/opinion/20080417_VOTE_FOR_BARACK_OBAMA.html">Philadelphia Daily News</a> and of a previously <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/17/obamas-small-town-superde_n_97179.html">uncommitted Oklahoma superdelegate</a>.</p>

<p>The spin wars are a vital exercise by the opposing camps in trying to influence the media's and the public's perception of who actually won a debate. The Clinton conference call was the first act of this most recent play, which will unfold throughout today and, likely, the rest of the way to next Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary.</p>

<h3>SEIU Joins the Pa. Fray</h3>



<span style="font-family:Times New Roman,times,serif; font-size:12px;">

<p>The <a href="http://www.seiu.org"><strong>Service Employees International Union</strong></a> is joining the ad fray in Pennsylvania with commercials in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia starting today that highlight the rising cost of gas and tout <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/barack-obama/"><strong>Barack Obama</strong></a>'s ability to solve the problem.</p>

<p>The ad opens with a montage of people listing the exorbitant price -- ''$75"(!) -- of a full tank of gas these days, then pivots to drub the oil companies for the profits they are reaping.</p>

<p>"Too many politicians are in the pocket of big oil," says one man; "Barack Obama is different," says another. "He doesn't take money from PACs or lobbyists." Watch it here:</p>

<p>SEIU, which <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/02/seiu_to_consider_obama_endorse.html">endorsed Obama in February</a>, is also planning to have its members stake out a Philadelphia-area gas station today and hand out leaflets expressing their support for Obama's energy plan.</p>

<p>SEIU's ad buy will add to the <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/04/15/on_cable_obama_deluges_pa_with.html">significant advantage</a> that Obama and his surrogates are enjoying on the Pennsylvania airwaves at the moment.</p>

<p>Obama  and <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/hillary-clinton/"><strong>Hillary Rodham Clinton</strong></a> have been battling it out over the airwaves on the issue of late with Obama striking the most recent blow with an ad entitled "Dime":</p>

<h3>Keystone Kerfuffle: First Thoughts</h3>



<span style="font-family:Times New Roman,times,serif; font-size:12px;">

<p>The Fix is overloaded on pretzels and Alka-Seltzer cold medicine at the moment, but we couldn't shut down the computer for the night without offering a few additional thoughts on what we just witnessed.</p>

<p>We'll be back tomorrow with a fuller look at the Pennsylvania Democratic debate, but in the meantime this should tide you over. Offer your own thoughts on the proceedings in the comments section below.</p>

<p>* The first 45 minutes were <strong>Barack Obama</strong>'s toughest time in any debate. He came under withering assault from the moderators (and <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>) on a whole host of issues from the comments of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama's former pastor,  to his decision not to wear a flag lapel to his connections with a one-time member of  the Weather Underground. Time and again, Obama dismissed the questions as part of the politics of the past, something  that he was running to change.  Given both the number and nature of the questions he fielded, it would have been impossible for him to shine in those first 45 minutes. He survived -- at least as of this writing -- without making any more adverse news, which is an accomplishment in and of itself.</p>

<p>* Clinton, as usual, was incredibly well prepared from a policy standpoint. While she spent the first half of the evening watching Obama squirm under tough questioning, Clinton made clear her mastery of the major policy issues facing the country in the vesper half of the debate.  But, will it matter? As we noted earlier today, the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-poll16apr16,0,794499.story">L.A. Times/Bloomberg surveys</a> showed that voters in Pennsylvania, Indiana and North Carolina already believe she better understands a number of domestic issues than Obama and yet still opt for Illinois senator.</p>

<p>*The choice between the candidates  crystallized tonight. It is not, fundamentally, a choice about issues or even ideology -- it is a choice about approach.  Obama is an idealist, using nearly every question to appeal to the better angels in people; Obama sees the world as he wants it to be and believes he can make it. Clinton, on the other hand, is an unapologetic pragmatist; she has been through the wringer that is national politics before and knows how to play the game.  </p>

<p>*The longer the Democratic campaign goes on, the more clips Republican Sen. <strong>John McCain</strong>'s campaign can harvest for use against the eventual Democratic nominee. It's one thing for McCain to take note of ties between Obama and a former member of the Weather Underground; it's quite another for McCain's campaign to roll tape of Clinton making those accusations. You can bet Steve Schmidt of McCain's campaign was Tivoing every minute of tonight's proceedings for use when summer turns to fall.</p>

<h3>The Closing Statements</h3>



<span style="font-family:Times New Roman,times,serif; font-size:12px;">

<p>The two candidates' closing statements showed voters the true difference between them, which is far less about issues than about approach. Clinton billed herself as a known commodity and a pragmatist, Obama cast himself as a transformational figure and an unapologetic idealist.</p>

<p>"You can count on me," Clinton said during her close. "You know where I stand."</p>

<p>"We are at a defining moment in out history," said Obama. "The American people have lost faith in their government."</p>

<p>Boiled down, that is the space between the two and the choice they offer voters. Clinton argues she has been there and done that.  Obama seems to concede the idea that Clinton is a master of the political game, but he argues that the game fundamentally poorly serves the average voter.</p>

<p>It's a fascinating dichotomy between two candidates, who have spent the last 15 months getting to this point -- the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>Remember that opening and closing statements tend to factor heavily into how voters' perceive who won (and lost) the debate. These debates are all about moments, and the opening and closing moments offer the candidates the most unobstructed chance to have one such shining moment.</p>

<h3>Out-Gunned?</h3>



<span style="font-family:Times New Roman,times,serif; font-size:12px;">

<p>To commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Virginia Tech massacre, Charlie Gibson questioned both Clinton and Obama about why they -- and the Democratic Party -- have avoided pushing for more stringent gun control measures over the last few elections.</p>

<p>Clinton sought to make a third way argument that surely made her husband smile, arguing that she supports the Second Amendment while also sympathesizing with those who want to keep guns out of the hands of the wrong people.</p>

<p>"I respect the Second Amendment," Clinton said. "I respect the rights of lawful gun owners to own guns and use their guns. Most lawful gun owners also want to be sure we keep those guns out of the wrong hands."</p>

<p>Obama, surely cognizant of the danger of the question given his San Francisco "bitter" and "cling" comments, sought to downplay his past support for stringent gun control measures.</p>

<p>"As a general principle I believe the Constitution confers an individual right to bear arms," Obama said. Pushed by George Stephanapoulos concerning his support for a total gun ban on a 1996 questionnaire, Obama said he had never supported such a proposal and quickly switched to the core message of his campaign: "We have to get beyond the politics of this issue and figure out what is working."</p>

<p>Neither candidate was willing to  prolong the discussion, as they had done in responding to questions on Iraq and the economy -- a signal that gun control is a stone-cold loser for Democrats in a presidential race.</p>

<h3>Clinton, Obama Talk Iraq</h3>



<span style="font-family:Times New Roman,times,serif; font-size:12px;">

<p>Asked whether the situation on the ground will impact their previously stated positions to begin removing troops from Iraq as soon as they are elected president, Sens. <strong>Hillary Rodham Clinton </strong>(N.Y.) and <strong>Barack Obama </strong>(Ill.) said it would not.</p>

<p>"The president sets the mission, the generals and our troops carry out that mission," said Obama, offering a criticism of President Bush's reliance on the advice of Gen. David Petraeus in planning for America' future in Iraq.</p>

<p>Clinton sounded a similar sentiment, insisting that the only way for the Iraqis to stand up in the long term is for America to stand down.</p>

<p>"Only through our commitment to withdraw will the Iraqis begin to do what they have failed to do all of these years," said Clinton. "We don't know what will happen if we withdraw. We know what won't happen if we don't."</p>

<p>While those positions are sure to win Clinton and Obama plaudits within their own party, it's easy to see how Sen. <strong>John McCain </strong>(Ariz.) and the Republican National Committee will play the issue in the fall. You can imagine the RNC press release now: "Democrats Prepared To Reject General's Advice".  </p>

<p>Polling  consistently shows that a majority of voters no longer believe the war was worth fighting and believe the U.S. should begin to withdraw. But, McCain will focus much of his campaign on the idea that regardless of how this country got to where it is in Iraq, we must stay until the job is done.</p>

<p>It is a stark -- and fundamental -- difference between the two sides. Only seven more months until the general election!</p>

<h3>A Debate Devoid of Issues So Far</h3>



<span style="font-family:Times New Roman,times,serif; font-size:12px;">

<p>Roughly 45 minutes into the ABC debate, the proceedings have been heavy on process and incredibly light on policy.</p>

<p>Obama has taken the brunt of the questioning, being forced to answer for a laundry list of potential Republican attacks against him -- from comments made by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright to the fact that he doesn't wear a flag pin on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>While Obama seemed to deftly handle questions about remarks he made to a group of San Francisco donors last weekend, he struggled quite a bit more when asked to answer for Wright, his former pastor.</p>

<p>Obama repeated that he was not in attendance at church when Wright made his most controversial remarks and didn't hear about them until it became an issue in the campaign. Obama appeared somewhat unsure when pressed by moderator George Stephanapoulos about whether Wright loved America as much as Obama did.</p>

<p>Obama's defense -- " I wasn't aware of all of these statements" -- made him sound like a run-of-the-mill politician rather than the change agent he has cast himself in the campaign.</p>

<p>On the flag pin question as well as a reference to his ties with a former member of the Weather Underground, Obama dismissed the issues as reflective of the old politics that served as a distraction that voters were not interested in.</p>

<p>"This is the kind of manufactured issue that our politics has become obsessed with," Obama said with a bit of anger (or at least frustration) in his voice. "There is no doubt that the Republicans will attack both of us. What I have displayed in the course of this primary is I can take a punch."</p>

<p>Clinton was all too happy to join in the fray, insisting that the questions being raised by the moderators were legitimate topics of debate for primary voters -- insisting that Republicans are certain to use these controversies against Obama in a general election campaign.</p>

<p>Clinton took a hit -- briefly -- for her exaggerations about  coming under fire during a visit to  Bosnia.  "On a couple of occasions in the last weeks, I just said some things that I knew not to be the case," she said. "I am embarrassed by it, I have apologized for it."</p>

<p>If you are in Obama's campaign, it's hard to see how you can be happy about the first 45 minutes of the debate. He may be getting more speaking time than Clinton but he is being forced to answer for every vaguely hot-button issue raised about him over the last 15 months of the campaign.</p>

<h3>Obama Addresses "Bitter," Clinton Hits Back</h3>



<span style="font-family:Times New Roman,times,serif; font-size:12px;">

<p>It didn't take long for the comments made by Sen. <strong>Barack Obama </strong>(Ill.) at a San Francisco fundraiser last weekend to become fodder for tonight's debate.</p>

<p>Asked by Charlie Gibson whether he understood why some people would be offended by his comments -- about "bitter" victims of small-town economic distress clinging to their religion and guns -- Obama reiterated his past statements that he had simply misspoken and that his remarks did not reflect his personal views about small town residents.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that I can see how people were offended," he said. " It is not the first time I have made a statement that was mangled up and it won't be the last."</p>

<p>Clinton was not ready to let the issue drop, calling Obama's statement a "fundamental misunderstanding" of why people are religious or value their right to own a gun. "I just don't believe that is how people live their lives," Clinton added.</p>

<p>End of story? Not even close.</p>

<p>Obama, clearly loaded for bear on this issue coming into the debate, evoked Clinton's 1992 comment that she would not simply stay at home and bake cookies as first lady as evidence that politicians occasionally misspeak and that it is wrong to conclude that a misstatement represents the true feelings of a politician.</p>

<p>"The problem we have in our politics is you take one person's statement if it's not properly phrased and you just beat it to death," said Obama. "That's what Senator Clinton has been doing over the last four days."</p>

<p>Clinton, of course, responded -- noting that her comments about Obama as an elitist did not come out of thin air but rather developed as a result of his remarks to a group of donors in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Bitter Battle #1 has been fought. The Fix thinks it was a draw -- although Obama gets points for sticking in the shiv with his "baking cookies" reference.</p>

<h3>Opening Statements</h3>



<span style="font-family:Times New Roman,times,serif; font-size:12px;">

<p>Tonight's Democratic debate in Philadelphia began in the most traditional of manners -- opening statements by Sens. <strong>Hillary Rodham Clinton </strong>(N.Y.) and <strong>Barack Obama </strong>(Ill.).</p>

<p>Obama won the coin toss (symbolic?) and elected to go first, touching on the frustration that people across Pennsylvania and America feel without ever mentioning the "bitter" remarks that drew so much attention over the past five days.</p>

<p>"This election offers us an opportunity to change that," said Obama. "I am running for president to ensure the people of America are heard in the White House."</p>

<p>Clinton, providing yet more evidence that there is very little difference between the two candidates, echoed Obama's sentiments.</p>

<p>"There is a lot of concern across Pennsylvania and America," said Clinton. "People feel as though their government is not solving problems. I am running for president because I know we can meet the challenges of today."</p>

<p>One other note: ABC News is REALLY playing up the fight theme for tonight's debate. "We are in round 15 of a scheduled 10-rounder," moderator Charlie Gibson said at the outset of the the proceedings.</p>

<h3>Pennsylvania Debate Preview</h3>



<span style="font-family:Times New Roman,times,serif; font-size:12px;">

<p><strong>UPDATE, 5:55 pm</strong>:  The Fix has finally arrived at the site of tonight's Democratic presidential debate -- a mere two and a half hours before the event begins.  The debate is being billed as a prize fight of sorts (maybe the last one of the primary) and the signs dotted everywhere at the <a href="http://www.constitutioncenter.org/">National Constitution Center</a> play up that idea; "Clinton vs Obama: The Democrats Debate" they read.</p>

<p>As Fixistas know by now, reporters don't actually get to sit in the hall for these debates but are relegated to press filing centers. And, after a series of nights (and days) spent in just these sort of places, we fashion ourselves connoisseurs of them.  The best thing about this one? Pretzels with mustard provided -- a Philly classic.  Worst thing: It's freezing, which does little for The Fix's cold.</p>

<p>The Fix spent most of the midday hours on a train up to Philadelphia and during that time had an opportunity to look more closely at three polls (in Indiana, Pennsylvania and North Carolina) released last night by the Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg.</p>

<p>A few thoughts:</p>

<p>* <strong>Hillary Clinton's</strong> entire campaign at this point is premised on the idea that she is the stronger candidate against Sen. J<strong>ohn McCain</strong> (R-Ariz.) in the fall general election campaign.  Across each of the three states, however, voters disagreed.  In Pennsylvania, 21 percent said Clinton had the best chance of being elected in the fall while 33 percent chose <strong>Barack Obama</strong> and 37 percent said the two had an equal chance. The numbers were far more lopsided in favor of Obama in Indiana (18 percent Clinton/37 percent Obama/28 percent equal) and North Carolina (17 percent Clinton/39 percent Obama/27 percent equal). </p>

<p>* Voters in all three states believe Clinton understands issues like trade and health care better than Obama, even though it doesn't necessarily lead them to support her.  In Indiana, 48 percent said Clinton "better understands" trade issues as compared to 27 percent who said it is Obama with the superior grasp of the issue; in North Carolina 44 percent said Clinton knew the trade issue best wile 29 percent named Obama.  And yet, in both states Clinton trailed in the overall vote --  40 percent to 35 percent in Indiana and 47 percent to 34 percent in North Carolina. Why? Because on a comparison of the personal characteristics of the two candidates, Obama swamps Clinton.  Who has more "honesty and integrity"? Obama leads Clinton by 35 points in North Carolina, 31 points in Indiana and 19 points in Pennsylvania. On which candidate could bring about real change, Obama's margins are similar in all three states.  What does that tell us? That even though voters may think Clinton is better equipped to handle the issues they care most about, they are prioritizing personal qualities far more than issue stances in the primary fight to date.</p>

<p>* The number of Democrats who believe the country is off on the "wrong track" is truly stunning.  In Pennsylvania, just seven percent of Democrats said the country was headed in the right direction while 85 percent (!) said it was on the wrong track.  The numbers in Indiana (11 percent right direction/81 percent wrong track) and North Carolina (12 percent/81 percent) are similar.  With that kind of dissatisfaction within the party, it would seem that much of the hand-wringing by party strategists about the potential damage done by the protracted primary is much ado about nothing. Democrats are deeply unhappy about the way President Bush has led the country and it's hard to imagine that level of discontent disappearing simply because their preferred Democratic candidate didn't win the party's nod.</p>

<p><strong>THE ORIGINAL POSTING</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>PHILADELPHIA, Pa.</strong> -- Tonight's Democratic debate between Sens. <strong><a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a></strong> (Ill.) and <strong><a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/hillary-clinton/">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a></strong> (N.Y.) marks the first time in 50 days that the two have shared a stage.</p>

<p>Given that hiatus -- and all of the news (Rev. Wright, Tuzla, bitter, etc.) that has transpired during it -- expectations are extremely high for tonight's faceoff at the National Constitution Center.</p>

<p>Unlike the three past debates between Obama and Clinton, the pressure is on the Illinois senator tonight as he works to put his comments about Pennsylvania voters being "bitter" about their circumstances behind him.</p>

<p>Polling conducted in the aftermath of the media firestorm seems to suggest that most voters aren't particularly affected by Obama's comments -- a development that Obama is almost certain to make note of in the back and forth tonight. But, Clinton and the debate's moderators are almost certain to push Obama on the issue.  How he reacts could well determine what the storyline is coming out of tonight.</p>

<p>The Fix will be reporting from the debate site but in the meantime here's a few other things to mull in advance of the proceedings:</p>

<p>* <strong>Clinton</strong> -- Naughty or Nice? Clinton's approach has fluctuated widely in recent debates. At times she is magnanimous to and about Obama, at others she appears to be looking for every opportunity to knee-cap him. Our guess is that the tougher Clinton is the one who takes the stage tonight; her campaign, rightly or wrongly, believes that the "bitter" comments made by Obama offer her perhaps her best chance yet in the campaign to change the narrative.  If Clinton can't make "bitter" stick to Obama tonight, she may never have another opportunity to do so; no other debates have been scheduled in the remaining six weeks of the nomination fight.</p>

<p>* <strong>Obama</strong> -- Professor or Pugilist?  Like Clinton, Obama has adopted a number of different styles during the 20 (or so) debates of the campaign. The Illinois senator is best when goes off script -- often during a heated exchange between candidates. Obama is quick on his feet and has a natural sense for repartee. He's at his worst when faced with a question about the economy or health care; he dips into his college professor mode, offering a series of philosophical arguments almost entirely bereft of specifics or any real passion.  For The Fix, the difference in Obama's approaches is similar to listening to a CD and seeing a band live.  Obama needs to go for that live feel tonight.</p>

<p>* <strong>Moderators</strong>: Too often the role of the men (and women) who share the stage with the candidates is overlooked.  The truth of the matter is that the moderators guide the questioning, deciding when to give a candidate a chance to respond and when to simply move on, when to push on an answer and when to let it lie.  That role tonight falls to "World News" anchor <strong>Charlie Gibson</strong> and "This Week" host <strong>George Stephanapolous</strong> -- two of the best in the business.  Do the two men decide to push Obama to further explain the "bitter" hubbub or take his previously stated explanation, which he is sure to repeat tonight, at face value? What about Clinton's exaggerations about her 1996 trip to Bosnia (a controversy that has largely been eclipsed in the media in the last week or so)?  </p>

<p>* <strong>Domestic or Foreign? </strong> The economy continues to be the dominant issue for voters in Pennsylvania -- and elsewhere across the country.  Given its front-of-the mind status for voters, does the economy dominate the questioning and answers tonight? Or, in the wake of Gen. <strong>David Petraeus'</strong> testimony to Congress last week, will Iraq be the central topic of the debate? Clinton has to hope for the former scenario as she is on much more solid ground talking about domestic issues like economy and health care than about the war and her vote for the 2002 use-of-force resolution against Iraq.</p>

<p>* <strong>The Crowd</strong>: The vast majority of people watching tonight's proceedings -- The Fix included -- will be doing so on television. But, how the crowd in the debate hall could have an impact.  If one or the other candidate is booed or heckled, it could well affect how folks on television perceive the winners and losers from tonight.  (Doubt us? Check out how Obama's campaign used a few shouted "No's" during a Clinton speech to great effect in his latest ad.)  The moderators will, of course, ask the crowd to refrain from any exclamations but we all know that is a rule that won't be followed.</p>
