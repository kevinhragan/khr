			<p>Courtesy of Glenn Greenwald at Salon, we find that the corporate media has reported on the major issues facing Americans with the following <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/04/05/media/index.html">emphasis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the past two weeks, the following events transpired. A Department of Justice memo, authored by John Yoo, was released which authorized torture and presidential lawbreaking. It was revealed that the Bush administration declared the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights to be inapplicable to &#8220;domestic military operations&#8221; within the U.S. The U.S. Attorney General appears to have fabricated a key event leading to the 9/11 attacks and made patently false statements about surveillance laws and related lawsuits. Barack Obama went bowling in Pennsylvania and had a low score.</p>
<p>Here are the number of times, according to NEXIS, that various topics have been mentioned in the media over the past thirty days:</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Yoo and torture&#8221;</u> - 102</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Mukasey and 9/11&#8243;</u> &#8212; 73</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Yoo and Fourth Amendment&#8221;</u> &#8212; 16</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Obama and bowling&#8221;</u> &#8212; 1,043</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Obama and Wright&#8221;</u> &#8212; More than 3,000 (too many to be counted)</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Obama and patriotism&#8221;</u> - 1,607</p>
<p><u>&#8220;Clinton and Lewinsky&#8221;</u> &#8212; 1,079</p></blockquote>
<p>If there were not already ample reasons why corporations should be banned forever from owning media outlets in a free society, this record of treason against the American public should be sufficient for even the most doctrinaire free market advocate.</p>
<p>A corporation is incapable of human values or awareness.  It only seeks money.  When the media is highly concentrated,  as it is, the problem becomes even worse because the companies that own the news outlets also own many other potentially profitable vehntures and subordinate the news to those interests as well.</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>

				<small>March 21, 2008 on 11:17 am | In <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?cat=4" title="View all posts in Current Affairs" rel="category tag">Current Affairs</a>,  <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?cat=9" title="View all posts in Social and Political Theory" rel="category tag">Social and Political Theory</a> | <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?p=114#comments" title="Comment on Heretical Thoughts About Taxes">4 Comments</a></small>
						
			<p>I will appreciate it if anyone has thoughtful criticisms of the following.  Ideologues unconcerned with actual events need not waste their (and my) time.</p>
<p>We have seen that Wall Street has both helped itself to enormously disproportionate incomes due to their capacity to game the system and that they have made themselves so essential to us that we are taxed to bail them out.  This is hardly the first time.  Under Ronald Reagan the Savings and Loan industry was bailed out for incompetently losing billions.</p>
<p>As then so now, the middle class and poor are paying so the ultra rich can game the system to socialize the risks they take while privatizing the gains.  The Bush family is an excellent example, Neil Bush being as incompetent a businessman as his presidential brother, losing billions, and being bailed out so he can continue living in unarned luxury.</p>
<p>There has never been a stronger argument for a highly graduated income tax.  I think a person can get by in comfort on a disposable annual income of, say, $1 million.  Does anyone really need more?  There should be generous allowances for charitable giving because individuals can often do better than the government – and such allowances enable them to help others they otherwise might not.  But for the take-it-all-home types, nail them.</p>
<p>Libertarians and conservatives will scream this is unfair – taking away people’s rewards for taking risks and succeeding.</p>
<p>In a perfect world where the rich do not consistently game the system in their favor their point could still be contested for reasons too complex for a blog discussion, but it would be stronger than it is. In the world we actually have their argument is naïve at best, willfully blind at worst.</p>
<p>I will focus on reasons rooted in the world we actually have</p>
<p>First – simple justice.  The corporate and financial rich in particular have gamed the legal and economic system for a long time, using the power of government to take from others for their personal benefit.  In self-defense we need to reduce their incentives to rob us.  If they can keep less wealth they have fewer incentives to use the government to give them more.</p>
<p>Second – the bankers and their kind tell us their industries are too important to the economy to fail.  They demand special privileges as a result.  If they are too important, and so need the privileges, those running them should not be allowed to use their positions to enrich themselves disproportionately.  The price of being protected is not being able to take advantage of your privileged position.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we should break up any and all such businesses because a free society cannot allow any business to become that important.</p>
<p>I have real sympathy for the most creative entrepreneurs and creative geniuses.  They should be able to make a very good living.  But for them money is not the only pay off, unlike many of those in the financial industry.  But even after the New Deal, when our tax system was at its most progressive, there was no shortage of wealthy people in the country.  But we were not in the predicament we are in now that the so-called free market people have been in charge for several decades.</p>
<p>My point is NOT to equalize everyone.  But it is to reduce the incentives of the most financially successful to create dynasties of privilege over everyone else by reducing both their means to game the system and their payoffs for doing so.  Maybe a very steep income tax at the highest income levels is not the way to go.  There might be better ways.  But if we want to remain a free society we need to defend ourselves against the ruthless oligarchs who have come ever more brazenly to dominate our country.

				<small>March 9, 2008 on 12:36 pm | In <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?cat=4" title="View all posts in Current Affairs" rel="category tag">Current Affairs</a>,  <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?cat=9" title="View all posts in Social and Political Theory" rel="category tag">Social and Political Theory</a> | <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?p=113#respond" title="Comment on Columbia, Ecuador, Venezuela and the Democratic Peace">No Comments</a></small>
						
			<p>One of the most important developments in the modern world is the rise of democracies to becoming the dominant part of the world’s population, and economic and military power.  The chief reason this unprecedented development is important is that only liberal democracies never fight wars with one another.  The  recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/world/americas/09colombia.html?th&#038;emc=th">peaceful settlement</a> of the crisis on the borders of Ecuador, Columbia, and Venezuela is a powerful illustration of this fact.</p>
<p>The pioneering work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Rummel">Rudy Rummel</a> powerfully <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/">demonstrates</a>  that the democratic peace is significant statistically, and both he and I (scroll to <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?page_id=16">here</a>  and down to democratic peace article)  have explained the reasons for this continued peace: that democracies are emergent orders and not hierarchical organizations, as are undemocratic states.  Different dynamics apply to their behavior as systems, dynamics that tend to keep the peace when both parties are democratic.</p>
<p>For the first time in human history a solution to war might have evolved, and done so unintentionally.  It does not guarantee peace.  There are too many sociopaths in power and serving the role of neoconservative advisors to ever be 100% certain.  But it is very unlikely.</p>
<p>The largest threat to that solution – the threat of the US Presidency evolving into a Caesarist dictator elected every four years - now seems destined to failure.  A powerful executive independent of domestic democratic pressures is no more likely to keep the peace than any other kind of dictator or king, as Kaiser Wilhelm demonstrated so tragically in WWI.  He is too insulated from what it is that promotes peace which are the dynamics of a democratic system far more than the character of the individuals who hold power.<br />
This is the one area where Prof. Rummel and I parted ways.  He supported our imperial venture against Iraq because he believed the Bush administration intended to build a democracy there and that once Hussein was gone it would be possible to construct one.  I opposed it because I believe democracies have to build on internally generated institutions currently lacking in Iraq and because the centralizing of American political power would weaken the reasons for the democratic peace by moving us towards a government like Wilhelmine Germany: a dictator abroad with democracy locally.</p>
<p>I believe events have demonstrated who was correct here.  There are things we and other democracies can do to promote more democracies, but imposing them violently on cultures with no previous experience of basic free institutions is not one of them.

			<p>This is Barack Obama’s speech against going to war in Iraq.  He spoke when others such as myself also opposed the war and took constant flak from right wingers and their Democratic enablers.</p>
<p>At the same time some, like Hillary Clinton, actively facilitated it and hundreds of thousands of deaths later, still refuse to admit an error.  She even has the temerity to attack Obama on issues of judgment and experience.  I urge anyone reading my blog to read Obama’s speech here and ask yourself who has the best demonstrated judgment. It is not long.</p>
<p>With thanks to Americacblog for originally <a href="http://www.americablog.com/2008/03/2002-speech-that-hillary-is-afraid-of.html">posting</a> it.</p>
<p>I will still vote for her if she is the candidate.  But I will feel queasy doing so.<br />
<br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">October 2, 2002</span></p>
<p>Good afternoon. Let me begin by saying that although this has been billed as an anti-war rally, I stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances. The Civil War was one of the bloodiest in history, and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword, the sacrifice of multitudes, that we could begin to perfect this union, and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil. I don&#8217;t oppose all wars.<br />

			<p>The Fund for the Study of Spontaneous Orders at the Atlas Economic Research Foundation is seeking papers exploring the theme</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">“ORDERS AND BORDERS”</span></p>
<p>for its <span style="font-weight: bold">Second Conference on Emergent Order and Society</span><br />
Selected papers will be presented at a conference to be held in Portsmouth, NH, November 1-4, 2008. After author revisions/responses, the papers will be published in our new, open source online journal, Studies in Emergent Order.  The site is presently under construction.</p>
<p>We urge all scholars interested in exploring how emergent order analysis can contribute to our understanding of the social world to consider submitting a proposal.  We seek original work in four basic areas:</p>
<p>1. Exploring the relations between emergent (spontaneous) orders and the instrumental organizations within them. For example, the relationship of corporations to the market, political parties to democracies, or schools of thought to science.  To what degree are they benign, mutually beneficial, or conflicting?</p>
<p>2. Exploring issues involving the intersection and overlapping of different emergent order processes. For example, how do science and the market influence one another? How do science and democracy influence one another?  To what extent can these influences be regarded as beneficial, neutral, or disruptive?</p>
<p>3. Exploring organizations that straddle the borders of different emergent orders. For example, the mass media must be both economically viable by serving consumers and also able to inform citizens in a democracy. A fishery must be economically viable and maintain its ecological sustainability.  Different emergent processes are coordinated by different rules biased towards different values.  How do they interact?</p>
<p>4. Exploring issues involving the borders of disciplines studying emergent phenomena. The distinction between emergent orders and instrumental organizations arose independently of disciplinary boundaries and a theoretical approach making use of it cuts across traditional disciplinary boundaries.  Thus much work in economics, anthropology, ecology, philosophy and sociology of science, and political science independently discovers and explores similar territory without benefiting from similar work elsewhere.  How might we develop a paradigm of study that integrates these boundaries?</p>
<p>Acceptable papers may be either case studies or more general theoretical explorations.<br />
We invite those unfamiliar with the first conference to examine papers prepared for that gathering.  You can view them at  <a href="http://emergentorders.pbwiki.com">http://emergentorders.pbwiki.com</a></p>
<p>The password for access to the wiki site is:  halcyon07</p>
<p>A description of the work of the Fund may be found on the Atlas website under the listing “Academic Programs” at <a href="http://atlasusa.org">http://atlasusa.org</a></p>
<p><br style="font-weight: bold" /><span style="font-weight: bold">Submission Guidelines and Procedures</span><br />
Paper proposals should be submitted by April 30, 2008.  The proposal should describe the anticipated argument and how it relates to at least one of the conference themes.  Proposals should be no more than two pages double spaced, not including an optional bibliography of works the author anticipates discussing.  Submit to William.Dennis@atlasusa.org</p>
<p>The Fund will select a maximum of 12 papers for inclusion in its conference, and will notify their authors by May 30, 2008.  Final papers must be submitted to the Fund by September 1, 2008 in order to ensure conference participants adequate time to read them in advance.  The Fund will pay those authors whose work is accepted a total of $2,000 for their paper, initial publication rights, and for their full participation in the conference, (plus room and board at the conference, and travel expenses, up to the equivalent of a roundtrip coach airfare from their location to the conference site). The Fund’s decision on the papers selected for the conference is final. Other support may be forth-coming for some of the other papers submitted, but no such support is guaranteed.

			<p>Some time ago <a href="http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/POM">The Pomegranate</a>, a Pagan academic journal, printed an attack on Paganism and deep ecology by Bookchinite Peter Staudenmaier: “Fascist Ecology: The ‘Green Wing” of the Nazi party and its Historical Antecedents.”  Staudenmaier’s article appeared in issue No. 15, Feb. 2001 (4-21), when it was a hard copy journal.  My response was in issue No. 16, May, 2001. (51-3).  If I remember correctly, his response appeared in its first disc version, as did my final reply.</p>
<p>Much has happened since then, but the irritating old canard about deep ecology and the Nazis raised its head from time to time in publications from the left, like the Bookchinites, and also the right, such as Anna Bramwell’s in many ways very interesting as well as deeply flawed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ecology-20th-Century-Anna-Bramwell/dp/0300045212/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1204161521&#038;sr=1-1.">Ecology in the 20th Century</a>. It also became in a milder way a point of contention in my debate some years back with <a href="http://www.kenwilber.com/home/landing/index.html">Ken Wilber</a>.    For my response see “Ken Wilber’s Critique of Deep Ecology and Nature Religion” after you go <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?page_id=7">here</a> and scroll down.  Happily, Ken has since substantially changed his views about us. Our last encounter was a very friendly one, though my views of an integral understanding of the world remain different from his.</p>
<p>The recent post by ‘ablue’ and MDM’s very nice support response have convinced me to offer up my comments again on this kind of argument.</p>
<p>Sadly I cannot provide Staudenmaier’s pieces but I think my responses discuss the bsic issues and I am sure if I make an error, folks like ‘ablue’ will be quick to correct me! <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?p=110#more-110">Continue reading Deep Ecology, Paganism, and Fascism Revisited&#8230;</a>

				<h2 id="post-105"><a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?p=105" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Obama For President">Obama For President</a></h2>
				<small>January 31, 2008 on 12:37 pm | In <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?cat=4" title="View all posts in Current Affairs" rel="category tag">Current Affairs</a> | <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?p=105#comments" title="Comment on Obama For President">6 Comments</a></small>
						
			<p>A friend asked me who I supported for President.  She knew it would be either Clinton or Obama.  As things now stand I would vote for a box turtle for President over any likely Republican candidate.  But why Obama and not Clinton?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>1. Hillary is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/10/17/defense-industry-embraces_n_68927.html">too close </a>to the defense industry - like very very close.</p>
<p>2. She has consistently supported Bush on key votes making it easier to attack others - most recently Iran.  I opposed the Iraq war well before it broke out and made predictions that have been just about 100% true. If I could do it, she has no excuse.  Obama also opposed it - and Clinton has tried to muddy that distinction.  It is a very important distinction - <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/10/11/iraq.deaths/">over 500,000</a> Iraqis are dead today who would not be had Bush not attacked.  Clinton shares in the guilt.  Obama does not.  Clinton has yet to fess up and admit she was wrong.  We&#8217;ve had enough Presidents who cannot admit they were wrong.</p>
<p>3. I think dynastic politics are bad for democracies, particularly democracies in trouble, like ours.  An office holder ideally should not be thinking about impact on family members&#8217; careers when making policy.  In fact, I think there should be a constitutional amendment barring direct spouses and descendants of federal office holders from holding the same office.</p>
<p>4. She makes a big point of her experience, but it is the people with experience that have gotten us into this horrible mess because most of them take as their frame of reference their friends in Washington, and not the well being of the country as a whole.  Bush did not have experience, but the rest of his crowd had plenty, and Democrats with experience did a lousy job of fighting against them.  Further, Clinton has refused to allow the public access to records of her experience (see below).</p>
<p>5. So far as I can tell - and this is speculative - Hillary is less likely than Obama to support <a href="http://www.talkleft.com/story/2007/2/18/15322/3156">cutting back the abuses</a> of Executive power that Bush got away with - and that is very important for the long run.  To be fair Clinto does say she would<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/10/11/clinton_vows_to_check_executive_power/"> cut back </a>the abuses.  I&#8217;ve had it with <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/57351">secrecy freaks</a>.  See also <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2007/11/archives2.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>6. Obama may do a great deal symbolically to encourage Black Americans to enter the main stream more whole heartedly than they have - especially young ones.  Now the same logic could be legitimately used for supporting a woman President - but women are rapidly entering the mainstreeam at ever higher levels.  It&#8217;s a matter of time before one becomes President.  I think the symbolic impact of Hillary Clinton getting it will be less than Obama getting it - and after the past 7 years I think we strongly need a symbolic btreak with the past and everything that is connected with the Republican Party in its present form.</p>
<p>7. Obama appeals to the non establishment wing of the Democratic Party and to the youth vote. The establishment wing has done a very poor job fighting the radical right and young people are a long term investment.</p>
<p>My bad boy side adds . . . And electing Obama will stick it to the South&#8230;</p>
<p>But if Hillary wins it, I will strongly support and happily vote for her.  Politics is rarely getting one&#8217;s first choice and compared to the likely Republican opposition, well, she is beyond comparison.</p>
<p>I wish both had shown more leadership on FISA, war spending, and other issues while in the Senate.  I&#8217;m not a super partisan of Obama, but I think on balance he&#8217;s a significantly better choice.
</p>

<p>When a new spiritual tradition becomes established within a society, both are changed.  In a way this is like when one of us enters on to a spiritual path.  While certainly changed in the process, we cannot each help but give our practice and beliefs an individual interpretation.  This is the core reason spiritual traditions diversify over time, as is certainly the case with NeoPaganism.</p>
<p>At the individual level, this growing diversity often reflects the richness of individual encounters with the sacred.  As such, I think it is a good thing.  That’s probably good because whatever I might think about this happening, it takes place within every tradition anyway.</p>
<p>But to say that diversification at the individual level is good does not imply that diversification due to societal impact is also good.  Sometimes it is bad, and sometimes it is very bad. <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?p=104#more-104">Continue reading Paganism and the Threat of Assimilation&#8230;</a>

				<small>January 11, 2008 on 10:10 pm | In <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?cat=2" title="View all posts in Spirituality" rel="category tag">Spirituality</a>,  <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?cat=8" title="View all posts in * Talks &#038; Workshops *" rel="category tag">* Talks &#038; Workshops *</a> | <a href="http://www.dizerega.com/?p=103#respond" title="Comment on I Will Teach a Healing Workshop at PantheaCon 2008">No Comments</a></small>
						
			<p>I will conduct a workshop on &#8220;Energy Healing: Beginning to Intermediate&#8221; at <a href="http://www.pantheacon.com/08/index.php">Pantheacon 2008</a>, in the <a href="http://www.doubletreesanjose.com/">Doubltree Hotel</a>, San Jose, on Monday, February 18, at 9 a.m.</p>
<p>I will combine explanation with opportunities for participants to have personal experiences they can then apply outside the context of this workshop. To some degree its content will depend on everyone&#8217;s prior experience. I will be prepared to discuss and where appropriate demonstrate:<br />
• Moving healing energy within your own body</p>
<p>• Auric cleansing</p>
<p>• Chakra stimulation</p>
<p>• Relieving energy coagulations that can cause pain and stiffness in yourself and others</p>
<p>• Working with depression in others</p>
<p>• Self-cleansing</p>
<p>• Energy cleansing herbs and baths</p>
<p>• Healing spirits</p>
<p>• The importance of motivation and visualization</p>
<p>• Applying these methods in covens and other small groups</p>
<p>This workshop will integrate what I have learned from six years close study with a Brazilian shamanic healer as well as over twenty years of personal healing practice towards others. What you learn here will grow in its effectiveness the more you apply it afterwards.</p>
<p>Pantheacon is the largest West Coast Pagan gathering and well worth attending if you share our ways.
