1. grab and expand tarball.  Maybe
   # scp ammut:/root/php-5.2.0.tar.gz /root
   # cd /root; tar xzf php-5.2.0.tar.gz

2.  cd /root/php-5.2.0

3. Now, configure your PHP.  This is where you customize your PHP
    with various options, like which extensions will be enabled.  Do a
    ./configure --help for a list of available options.  In our example
    we'll do a simple configure with Apache 1 and MySQL support.  Your
    path to apxs may differ from our example.

   ./configure --with-apxs --with-curl --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql --with-config-file-path=/etc/apache/php.ini

4. make
5. make install

    If you decide to change your configure options after installation,
    you only need to repeat the last three steps. You only need to 
    restart apache for the new module to take effect. A recompile of
    Apache is not needed.
  
    Note that unless told otherwise, 'make install' will also install PEAR,
    various PHP tools such as phpize, install the PHP CLI, and more.

#some make output:
You may want to add: /usr/local/lib/php to your php.ini include_path


6. Setup your php.ini file:

      cp php.ini-dist /usr/local/lib/php.ini

#php.ini is in /etc/apache.  Left this alone. 

    You may edit your .ini file to set PHP options.  If you prefer your
    php.ini in another location, use --with-config-file-path=/some/path in
    step 3. 
    
    If you instead choose php.ini-recommended, be certain to read the list
    of changes within, as they affect how PHP behaves.

14. Edit your httpd.conf to load the PHP module.  The path on the right hand
    side of the LoadModule statement must point to the path of the PHP
    module on your system.  The make install from above may have already
    added this for you, but be sure to check.
        
    For PHP 5:
                      
      LoadModule php5_module libexec/libphp5.so
      
15. And in the AddModule section of httpd.conf, somewhere under the
    ClearModuleList, add this:
    
    For PHP 5:
    
      AddModule mod_php5.c

16. Tell Apache to parse certain extensions as PHP.  For example,
    let's have Apache parse the .php extension as PHP.  You could
    have any extension(s) parse as PHP by simply adding more, with
    each separated by a space.  We'll add .phtml to demonstrate.

# don't seem to be using this
      AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml

    It's also common to setup the .phps extension to show highlighted PHP
    source, this can be done with:
    
      AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
     
    You can leave the above as-is.

vi /etc/apache/mod_php.conf 
:%s/4/5/g


17. Use your normal procedure for starting the Apache server. (You must
    stop and restart the server, not just cause the server to reload by
    using a HUP or USR1 signal.)

# /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd restart



# on debian:
apititude install aptitude install libapache-mod-php5 php5
/etc/init.d/apache restart
# make sure the apache2 stuff doesn't sneak in.
apache-modconf apache enable mod_php5 (might be needed)
