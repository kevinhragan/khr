sbp doesn't set vlan tag
  verify switch port is in trunk mode
  test over wire
    need xgig; or other method to prove traffic routed correctly
    xgig would work if used at peer end and fiber interface there
       should be able to see pcp bits without xgig

todo:
  study up on dell dcb features
  check out debugfs; ronald's commands
  add 3260 vlan for iscsi testing
     














debugfs
  'dump vsi 524': gets dcb config at the end.
  'dump stats':  ethtool type stats
  'dump port": get dcb brief dcb config

strict priority test:
  sut does receive and modify it's config correctly.  this is seen in trace captureand dumping interfaces config to dmesg.  traffic is not favoring strict ports.  Hard to prove this 100%, iperf sessions not going above 140Gbs.
